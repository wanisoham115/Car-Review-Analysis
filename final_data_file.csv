Most cars have had the major issues taken care of and each car listed has a few, the engine and transmission of the MB have been pretty much bullet proof prices are all over the place on them. I'm aware of the engine issues of the E60 M5, to fix the issue before the bearings go bad is about 3K, and the Vanoas seals would need to be replaced, that is the two issues with the V10. The E60 M5's with the fixes would run me about 25K (that includes the car.)

No chance of doing that in the huge and crowded Honda dealer waiting area. They don't give you the option of adjusting the blaring TVs that I recall.  The available snacks at the Acura dealer are a small thing, but they are nice—premium coffee, premium tea, bottled water, a variety of snack bars, chips, etc. I got a small bottle of water to put in my car's cup holder and a nutrigrain bar for under the armrest. Was probably a fluke that I was the only one there, but it was peaceful and I got a bit of work done. I also feel like they were more focused on me and my car. When I took my wife's CR-V a week ago for an oil change the Honda dealer didn't remember to reset the oil monitor. That's only a small thing, and I reset it at home, but it seemed like maybe a lack of attention to detail?  I just checked their price list, and a regular oil change service at Huffman Acura at Oxmoor is $45—which is only five bucks more than the Honda dealer iirc. As I said, my service was ""free"", but I haven't yet figured out why the list price before they did the NC was $65. Doesn't add up if synthetic oil is only $10 more, but probably I missed some fine print somewhere.  I imagine the regular oil change would be fine once my free ones are done, but I do like the idea of a little extra insurance with the extra good oil.

So what is this LL-01 thing that Mobil can't meet?  For what it's worth, when we had to demonstrate starts at -65 deg F we used an Esso oil that met MIL-L-7808. It coked up more at high temperatures but performed better at low temperatures.  The way most, if not all, of the cars used by the people on these boards are used, the oil you use is going to be fine.

To my amazement, after the crowds at the Honda dealer service bays starting well before opening, I was the first and only one in line. When my dealer leased the car they gave 2 years of maintenance on the house, and so I got an oil change and car wash for no charge today—and they even used ""Duramax"" synthetic oil. The details of the Acura oil life monitor don't really come through in this picture, but it's an old fashioned oil can like for the tin man in the Wizard of Oz. It's actually a full color cutaway (as I say not visible in the photo) which shows golden colored oil. The normal price of $65 seems a bit steep for an oil change, check of the car, washer fluid, car wash, vacuum, etc. but for long engine life changing the oil regularly with synthetic seems like a good idea.

This enhances performance as well as suitability for the every day. For an especially light-footed handling with significantly improved drive stability.  Advantage in daily use: at low speeds, the system moves the back wheels against the front wheels in position. This results in a virtual shortening of the wheel position. The turning curve is reduced, the steering response in curves is significantly more dynamic and parking is easier – you will feel it.  Advantage when driving in a sporty style: at greater speeds the system steers the back wheels in the same direction as the front wheels, that are in position. Driving stability increases with the virtual increase in wheel position, the agility through the simultaneous steering of front and back wheels.

Mazda jumped nine spots to finish third -- making it the most improved brand this year -- while Subaru, Kia, Infiniti, Audi, BMW, Mini and Hyundai rounded out the top 10.  Overall, Consumer Reports noted that when an automaker decides to make a vehicle more complicated, reliability often can dip as there are more things that can go wrong with a vehicle. Tesla, for example, made air suspension and all-wheel drive standard on the 2017 Model S, and it affected the car's reliability.  The nonprofit also highlighted the trend of automakers turbocharging smaller engines to give vehicles both pep and fuel economy -- with mixed results. Lexus has the most reliable turbo powertrain, followed by Honda and Porsche, while Hyundai and Mini have the most problematic ones, Consumer Reports said.  While automakers are adding more turbos, they're also increasingly pairing them with complicated transmissions that have upward of eight, nine and 10 gears, said Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing.

The suspension system was as subtle as a child's birthday party bounce house. Bottom line: Not class competitive, not even close.

Now for some good surprises: There is no doubt in my mind that Hyundai has arrived as one of the world's elite automakers. The Genesis G70 sport sedan is a bona fide threat to BMW, Audi and Mercedes. The 3.3-liter twin-turbo V-6 is a rocket booster of an engine. The chassis is firm. The steering and brakes are dialed in perfectly.  Despite the copycat German influenced interior, the G70 was the best car I have tested this year....  Acura's RDX, despite having a schnoz inspired by the late comedian Jimmy Durante, is a terrific crossover — quiet, smooth, loaded with safety technology and equipped with a great sounding 2.0-liter turbo engine that is mated to a 10-speed automatic.  But the Jaguar I-Pace gets my vote as the utility of the year. It may have four doors and a higher ride height than a coupe, but it drives like a pure sports car. The torque from the twin electric motors is powerful and instant. The interior is typical Jaguar -- high quality and very stylish. True, the infotainment system can be fussy, but you forget that when you are driving. The I-Pace will get my vote for Utility of the Year....""

Credit for that largely goes to the new platform those cars now ride on, providing more premium proportions and an enormous 4.9-inch increase in length. The stretched-out 2019 S60 is longer than all eight cars in our most recent Big Test comparo and boasts a back seat that feels far more livable than what you'll find in most competitors....  If all-wheel drive isn't a must-have feature, take another look at the front-drive, 250-hp S60 T5 and V60 T5. Although the V60 T5's 6.9-second 0-60 time can't keep pace with many others in this class, it doesn't feel much slower than T6 models, which reach 60 about a second quicker. Sticking with the T5 also bumps fuel economy from 21/31-32 mpg city/highway to 24/36 mpg....  ....Although we wish that tech (called BLIS in Volvos) were standard across the line and not just on the R-Design and Inscription models, it's worth noting that a $36,795 S60 Momentum base model starts thousands below the Lexus IS, Alfa Romeo Giulia, and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.

265,"October 16, 2018 12:13PM",benjaminh,"Here's are some 2-cent thoughts about putting premium gas in the TLX 2.4. Unlike stickguy's RDX—which has huge amounts of power and a great power to weight ratio—the 2.4 in the TLX is honestly just enough. If an RDX uses regular gas and loses maybe 5-10% of its power there's still plenty left over. But the TLX base weighs 3505 pounds, compared to I think about 3200 pounds for a 2013 Accord EX. In other words, if you lose maybe 5-10% of your horsepower by going to regular it's a definite hit.  The last generation Accord's 2.4 and the current TLX 2.4 are similar engines, but they aren't identical. First, with the TLX 2.4....  ""To maximize power output, the 2.4-liter engine has a dual-stage intake manifold has two different intake runner lengths that are selected based on the operating conditions. An actuator and a set of four butterfly valves control the intake runner switching process. At low engine speeds, the long runners are used to improve low-end torque. At higher engine speeds the system switches to the short intake runners for greater high rpm power. The result is intake tuning that is optimized for the engine's entire operating range.""  http://acuranews.com/acura-automobiles/channels/tlx-press-kit/releases/2018-acura-tlx-press-kit-powertrain  Second, the TLX 2.4 has a higher compression ratio compared to the last generation Accord 2.4. The TLX has a compression ratio of 11.6, compared to something like 10 for the Accord. I think there are some other differences with the Acura 2.4 as well. It definitely sounds better and more refined than the 2.4 in the last generation of Accord.  You almost certainly won't damage your Acura engine using regular (although personally I don't want to chance it with mine), but I don't think you are going to squeeze those extra 21 horses that the souped up TLX 2.4 has over the last generation of Accord 2.4. And imho you need every one of extra horses in some situations when you are accelerating a car that weighs 3500 pounds. Just my 2 cents. I like to drive a little fast and do somewhat sporty maneuvers sometimes, and the TLX works for that. The TLX is about a third of second faster to 60 than a base 320i, but that's not saying a lot. The TLX 2.4 needs all the power it has—and part of that is that the engine is optimized for premium gas. My guess is that the next generation TLX will have a 2-liter c. 290 hp turbo as standard—and so the current lower-powered, lower-priced (and higher mpg) TLX will be a thing of the past probably starting in 2020.",bmwi optimized performance litacurae efficiency think horseperformance dont wont switches saying 24liter plenty short chance system long performances horses ensafety premium honesacuray extra great huge almost every 2liter next acurax weighs imho lose dualstage past low although high words similar arent ex going 60 needs damage still performance cents standard—and certainly maneuvers maximize mine base greater need intake souped definite range generation ratio 10 actuator sometimes compared efficiency 3505 tuning maybe differences 21 performance lowerperformanceed 24 switching drive personally pounds higher regular selected last heres compression 2013 accelerating set performancey 116 squeeze operating want two identical conditions 510 uses valves thoughts 2cent honda theres left faster has—and loses starting performances fast control first four buaudierfly definitely second lenfordhs well used lowend guess different somewhat result weight process situations 3500 works part probably sounds hit runner manifold performance 2020 amounts bmw0 stickguys 290 current something lot acura ratio—the beaudier performance one like acura—which puaudiing third thing enough based improve refined performance car c 2 unlike output runners haudipacuranewscomacuraautomobileschannelsacuraxpresskitreleases2018acuraacuraxpresskitperformancetrain thcadillac lowerpriced using

362,"October  4, 2018 12:08PM",benjaminhf,"But falling sales for ELL cars probably helps to make for the possibility of good deals....  Perhaps I'm the only one to regret it, but it looks like starting next year that lower-powered ELLs won't really be available. Currently the 320i has a 0-60 time, according to BMW, of 7.1 seconds. The Acura TLX 2.4 I have has been timed at 6.9 seconds, which is fast enough for me (and about half a second faster than my 2016 Accord CVT). But for the new generation of 3-series coming up it looks like they've not only eliminated the manual transmission but also taken out the less powerful version. So the lowest level of 2019 330i will have a 0-60 time of less than 6 seconds—but it will also cost c.$6k more than the current bottom-of-the-line 320i. Rumors are that the all-new 2020 Acura TLX will also have an standard 2-liter turbo engine with similar power and acceleration.  That's probably what almost all ELL buyers want in terms of power and acceleration, but once the least expensive 3-series starts at c.$42k msrp before options it might be out of reach for some who might otherwise buy it.  And I'm enjoying that on highway drives without ac I can get as much as 40 mpg with my 2018 TLX with the naturally aspirated 2.4 with the 8-speed transmission. I don't think a 2020 TLX with the 2.0 turbo will be able to get more than maybe 35 on the same drive, but obviously I don't know for sure. I assume that as with the 330i there will be a big price jump for the 2020 TLX. I could afford the current TLX, but the next one might be too rich for my blood....

379,"October  5, 2018 10:34AM",benjaminhf," With sales of the ILX last month down to 930 cars, I'd say the writing is probably on the wall. Acura saved at least a billion dollars by keeping the 2019 ILX on the 2012 Civic platform rather than making an all-new car with the 2016 Civic platform—and they've passed that savings on to the customer. But unless sales somehow explode my guess is that we're only a few years away from the end of the ILX. We'll see.  One weird little factoid is that when the ILX was first introduced for model year 2013 the list price for the base model was $25,900. And now six years later the base price of the ILX is again exactly the same—$25,900. But the 2013 ILX had the comparatively underpowered 2.0 engine as well as a lackluster 5-speed automatic transmission. The 2019 ILX has the TLX's 2.4 plus the TLX's 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter. Plus the 2019 ILX has a better interior than the 2013, a quieter ride, AcuraWatch, etc. When you account for inflation 25,900 in today's dollars would be about 29k. In other words, the 2019 ILX is a much better car with a huge price cut from 2013. But it's still difficult to get around the fact that it's a massively updated and improved 6-year old car—even if the price is now pretty compelling.

403,"September 26, 2018  1:47PM",benjaminhf,"The KBB reviewer makes some good points about the infotainment system on the TLX. As he says, it's not intuitive at first, but over time it becomes pretty good. And I'm now used to it and can use it pretty easily. My wife's new CR-V has just the touchscreen, and in some ways I prefer that, but believe it or not in other ways I prefer the TLX's 2-screen system. Let me try to briefly explain. So with the one touchscreen like with the CR-V—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. In other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from AndroidAuto or CarPlay goes away. Same with the climate controls on the CR-V. With the system on the TLX, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. And so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the TLX is displaying your stereo and climate controls. Plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the TLX it stays pristine. Finally, the TLX's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the CR-V. Sometimes you need to press an electronic ""button"" on the CR-V's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the TLX's screen almost always works the first time.  In terms of handling, even my wife has said she really likes the way the TLX drives.

PS Now that I've driven both the TLX and my wife's CR-V a lot, I've decided I like non-turbo engines slightly better. The 1.5T on the CR-V does have maybe a third of a second delay in acceleration when you floor it—but in certain situations that can seem like a substantial delay. And so turbo lag has been reduced with these new engines, but not completely eliminated.  PPS My guess is that the next generation TLX, due in maybe a year or so, will go turbo and take out the 4-wheel steering. I'd rather have a naturally aspirated engine and the 4WS.

For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle.  The A4 is also a very nice design, and the Audi is maybe the best-looking entry-level luxury car right now imho. The TLX is close, but I do think that the Acura calipers on the front grill are maybe a bit too large, like it's trying a little too hard? I'm getting used to it, but I think the styling details on the Audi are very nice.  I guess the real bargain for leasing when it comes to entry-level luxury cars is the ILX, which is basically the fanciest and most powerful 2015 Civic ever. Still, with a lease price of c. $200 a month it's a good deal for the money. It's close to the same price as leasing a Civic.

471,"August  4, 2018 11:53PM",benjaminh,"With destination the starting price for an Acura TLX is $33,995. That's a lot of money, but for that price the TLX comes with a moonroof, power heated seats, AcuraWatch, etc., etc. An Audi A4, BMW 320i, or Lexus ES350 with about the same level of equipment all have msrps of about $41k, making the 34k for the TLX seem pretty good. But some people put the A4, 320i, and ES350 in a higher category than the TLX.  For the entry-level model TLX probably some are cross-shopping the Accord EXL 1.5, which has an msrp with destination of about $31k. So one way to look at it would be what does the TLX base have that makes it worth $3000 more than an Accord EXL.  Here's my very subjective valuation of what the added features and qualities of the TLX are worth to me personally over an Accord EXL....  The exclusive 4-wheel steering of the TLX would be worth to me as an option at least $1200. The 4WS really helps make the steering better, from parallel parking, to medium speed cornering, to higher speed lane changes. Great system imho.  The 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter is worth at least $800 to me compared to the Accord's CVT.  The better suspension of the TLX compared to the Accord is worth at least $500 to me.  The quieter ride of the TLX is also worth about $500 to me.  The TLX's better and bigger brakes with their ""Premium Bosch 6-piston brake modulator"" another 500. Plus the ten spoke wheels look better to me on the TLX than the strange designs found on the Accord.  The longer Acura warranty—4 year bumper to bumper, and 6 year/70,000 mile engine and transmission is also worth maybe 500 to me. And the fact that they threw in 2 years of maintenance in a much nicer waiting area reinforces that.  The nicer interior parts all throughout the inside the TLX, and the more interesting and better-looking to me sheetmetal outside is worth at least another 1000, and maybe twice that.  Very subjectively to me then the TLX does seem to be ""worth"" c. 5000+ more than a comparable Accord, making the added cost of 3k seem like a good deal.

The ELS takes it to the next level, but the starting system is already equal to the best that Honda offers—and maybe it's even a little bit better? In terms of the leatherette, I would have been happy with that too. In fact, imho it's less worry because leatherette will last longer than probably almost anything else on the car, while leather after 8 years or so might be reaching the danger zone even if cared for.  The seating position in the TLX is just slightly lower than in my 2016 Accord.  But like you I did find the seating position of the 2018 Accord maybe a little too low.

My car's trip computer says 34.1 mpg for those same miles, which is obviously very close. This was for about 70% highway miles. This is is beginning to seem like slightly higher mpg than for my 2016 Accord with the CVT—a car that weighs c.200 lbs less. Puzzled by this. Could it be the 8-speed dual clutch transmission? Is a DCT sometimes more efficient than a CVT?  My 2016 Accord CVT was rated 36 on the highway—and that's about what I got. Sometimes I got a 1-2 mpg more, sometimes 1-2 mpg less, and sometimes right on.  The 2018 Acura TLX 8-DCT is rated 33 on the highway—and yet I seem to be getting 36-39 mpg on the highway. I regularly seem to be getting 3-5 mpg higher than the EPA rating, which has never happened for me before in decades of checking my mpg on my cars. And this is in the hot summer with the AC on.

This is esp. noticeable over slightly rougher pavement where we got a fair amount of tire/road noise in the Accords. This is muted with the TLX. Starting in 2018 Honda has started using some of the noise reduction engineering adapted from the TLX for the Accord. My guess is that there will probably still be a difference with the TLX even compared to the new generation of Accord, but not as much.  And tonight, I'll confess, I took another pleasure cruise in the TLX—although first I had to go to the gas station to get my first fill-up of premium. And yes, they told me at the Acura dealer that using regular won't hurt your engine, but honestly why would you sacrifice c. 20 horsepower with a car that's designed to use every horse it has. My feeling is that if you aren't going to put premium in a premium car when it's recommended that maybe you should get something else?  Anyway, the lower mpg of 22 was my c. 3 miles of stop and go traffic to the Costco gas station for my premium fill up.  And don't get excited about that upper mpg of 40. I think it's valid (although I need to check with this tank how accurate the mpg meter is), but this was a highway run of about 20 miles with light traffic going an almost steady c. 60-62 mph, although with the AC on fairly high and the car in Sport mode. This was on a series of 55 mph freeways around Louisville. So it's seemingly good mpg, but the reality is I'm usually going more like c.72 mph on 70 mph freeways back and forth between Louisville and Lexington. But if it's accurate, 40 mpg is about as high as I would have gotten in my Accord for this run.    @sda : You might check out a TLX, esp. if you can find one of the last of the 2018s.

591,"July 13, 2018  3:28AM",henryn,"My worst tire changing experience was on my 2000 F250 diesel, the one I used to pull the 5th wheel travel trailer. I was cruising down Interstate 10 and the right rear tire just let go. This was well out in the country, on the approach to the Brazos River bridge, actually. The break down lane was small, and the dropoff was pretty steep. That F250 was very big, and very heavy, and it came with a tiny bottle jack. I wasn’t really sure it was going to lift the truck, but it did. Precarious is a word that comes to mind for that huge truck perched in the air on that tiny bottle jack.  I got the lug nuts off, but the aluminum wheel had welded itself to the hub. I looked around, found a big chunk of concrete, and used that to try and break the wheel loose. I’m laying under the truck, whacking the back side of the wheel with the concrete chunk, and an 18 wheel tractor trailer comes whizzing by at 80 mph. Sliding by my parked, jacked up truck by about 18 inches, maybe less. So naturally the truck sways back and forth on that tiny bottle jack and I’m thinking, “What a way to die. Crushed under a damned truck trying to fix a flat tire.”  There was another occasion. Not dangerous, but embarrassing. I was pulling the 5th wheel and had a blow out. If you’ve ever owned a travel trailer, then you will already know that they tend to eat tires. I looked around for a good place to get off the road, and spotted some kind of business with a big empty parking lot and pulled in. I’m jacking up the travel trailer (I always carried a really good jack with that thing), and my wife comes around and says, “You realize this is a funeral home, right?”  I look around, and she’s right, it’s a funeral home. I tell her it doesn’t matter, no one is there. Except … They obviously had a service of some kind scheduled, and the parking lot starts filling up. I swear it didn’t take me more than 10 minutes to swap out that tire, but in that 10 minutes the parking lot went from empty to full. And every single person who came in was looking at me like I was transgressing against their dead relative.

610,"July 10, 2018  1:58PM",benjaminh,"The resale values/residuals for most luxury performance sedans are weak compared to something like a Honda Accord. As you all know, that sometimes makes getting a used one a good deal. Sometimes it seems like for just a thousand or two more than an Accord with the same years and mileage you can pick up a 320i, an A4, or a TLX. Even new it seems like the lease incentives on some luxury sedans are so high they they are almost giving you for free the added quality, features, and performance of the luxury car.  I've mentioned before that maybe the most interesting book on the auto industry I ever read is called ""Car: A Drama of the American Workplace"" by Mary Walton, published in 1999. This book was not about a luxury car, but instead about the second generation Taurus, which Ford was trying to push higher in the marketplace. Anyway, one of the memorable things about it for me was that—not surprisingly—every single part on a car goes through a tough process of figuring out what the cost and therefore quality of the part can be. Ford was trying to make the 1996 Taurus a car that people would buy without big rebates, and as it was first designed and for its first year they allowed a higher budget for the cost of various parts so they would feel nicer, and sometimes function better. When the 2nd gen Taurus flopped in the marketplace the project manager had to huddle with his designers and engineers and try to figure out in an almost brutal way how to take something like $1500 in costs out of the car, which involved getting cheaper parts here, there, and everywhere.  Since I read that I've been even more aware than I was before of the quality of big and small things in a car. Sitting in a rental Hyundai Sonata, for instance, I could almost immediately tell that most parts did not get quite as good a budget/engineering detail as the Honda Accords I used to own.  And now with my new TLX, I can tell that the amount spent on most parts is not surprisingly higher than for a Honda. For instance, the steering wheel buttons and controls have a quality and size on the TLX that a Honda just doesn't have. This is partially about aesthetics, but it also impacts function. The adaptive cruise controls etc. are easier and more intuitive to use in the Acura when compared with my wife's new CR-V with its small and comparatively cheap butttons.  Again, given the discounts and incentives that most luxury performance sedans need to move, it's almost like the customer is getting this added quality for very little cost—and in some cases almost for ""free.""",bmwi marketplace people mary therefore comfort ive aesthetics easier free big litacurae ford memorable costs weak amount added adaptive auto feel cheaper could take styling buconsolens valuesresiduals almost cheap acurax impacts surprisingly push high rental various efficiency american performanceers interesting rebates intuitive geaudiing designed deal mentioned know anyway nicer doesnt everywhere cases 1999 need walton industry aware features immediately cost generation instance controls sometimes project compared small detail ddodgea performance maybe audi ever trying single 1996 book even higher good partially new tell without lease brutal makes pick two make workplace cost—and years quality honda budget tough discounts function first siaudiing instead hyundai cruise incentives second since year published used try read that—not steering would gen figure get spent buauditons seems giving things surprisingly—every involved process part manager way buy 2nd designers etc comparatively use customer parts figuring goes something acura quite 1500 move allowed beaudier one like flopped also huddle resale wifes car given called size sedans thousand budgetperformanceering

Although it might be that the great deal I got was only available at this time for the significantly improved 2018 TLX. The 2017 TLX iirc lacked AcuraWatch and lacked AndroidAuto, both essential features imho.  On the TLX 2.4 the 0-60 acceleration, to be blunt, seems about the same as an Accord to me—although how you get there is different. At first acceleration seems faster in the TLX in 1st and 2nd, but then as it quickly goes toward 4th, 5th and beyond, it just loses punch. This is all in ""Normal"" mode.

It lacks the expected Korean floatiness and excessive brake dive, even at extremes. Take a corner too fast, brake hard and crank the wheel and the Rio will scrub off speed while maintaining way more grip than you’d come to expect. Credit the car’s rigid structure; the suspension pieces themselves are nothing special.  When it comes to tech, Kia has you covered with Bluetooth, a six-speaker stereo with satellite radio and a rear-view camera system, seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

989,"October 14, 2016  4:25PM",flightnurse," and this.. Mercedes-Benz extended its lead in a race with BMW for the luxury-car sales crown, as a series of new models position it to overtake its rival for the first time in a decade.  A jump in deliveries of SUVs and crossovers helped Mercedes increase sales almost twice as fast as BMW in the first nine months, expanding the Daimler AG unit's lead to 57,985 cars, according to data released by the manufacturers.  Mercedes is poised to achieve its 2020 target of unseating BMW AG's namesake brand as the world's biggest seller of premium vehicles already this year, Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche said this week, which would put Mercedes back on top for the first time since 2005.  Mercedes is winning over customers with a recently updated lineup of trendy models that appeal to younger buyers, including the GLC coupe and compact GLA sport utility vehicle.  BMW is responding with a revamp of its 5-Series business sedan to rival Mercedes's popular E-Class, adding new self-driving features that control speed, help drivers stay in lane and keep distance to nearby cars.  The 5-Series, set to hit showrooms in February, will range from a four-cylinder hybrid plug-in that can drive 45 kilometers on a single charge, to a more powerful eight-cylinder gasoline version, BMW said in a statement on Thursday.  The car is critical for BMW after an overhaul of its top-of-the-line 7-Series sedan received a muted response.  BMW has downplayed the impending loss of the No. 1 spot, shifting its view to maximizing profit and fund investments in new technologies.  ""Profitability remains our primary focus,"" BMW's head of sales Ian Robertson said in a statement on Thursday.  New entrants  Luxury-car makers are racing to compete on self-driving innovations while also having to spend more on developing electric cars to meet increasingly tough emissions regulation.  BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen AG's Audi brand last month outlined a major push into electric cars, which will add to their research-and-development costs. After hiking investment in plants, equipment and new technology from a peak this year, Daimler plans to rein back spending in the years ahead, CEO Zetsche said this week.  BMW's global deliveries rose 9.4 percent to 197,419 cars in September, boosting the nine-month total by 6 percent to 1.48 million vehicles, the company said in a statement.  By comparison, Mercedes's sales jumped 12.1 percent to 211,286 vehicles in September, lifting the total by 11.7 percent to 1.54 million, according to a separate statement. Audi slipped further back in third place with year-to-date deliveries of 1.41 million cars, a 4.5 percent gain.

The base engine is a very nice 2.4 liter direct-injected model that's a more advanced version of what you get on the Accord. But most competitors have turbo base models that are faster.  The 8-speed in-house dual-clutch transmission on the TLX with the 2.4 has gotten mostly good reviews, but the 9-speed that goes with the V-6 has gotten mixed to negative reviews.  Acura doesn't seem to get much credit for its high quality, durability, and reliability. And the exotic 4-wheel steering that's standard on the car doesn't seem to help it stand out, but no doubt cost a pretty penny to engineer and put into the car.

The size of the A4 is bigger then last Gen, so in comparison it's slight bigger then my 320, but the 3GT has more rear legroom.  I was surprised how well the CVT shifts, but there is still that rubber band feeling, the Auto in the Quattro was better, but not too sure if AWD is really needed here in the Desert. The 252 HP 2L has a lot of motivation, but our 3GT is quicker (it has the BMS stage 1) over all driving the car is drove well, both with CVT or Duel Clutch but I give the Dual Clutch the nod, pricing for the cars are very competitive, you can get a Premium Plus for about 46K fully loaded, very competitive with BMW and a 328i. Even in Quattro you can tell the car is based on FWD. Fit and Finish was first rate, and would give Audi a nod for the feel of the leather over both of our BWW's.  The size of the A4 felt just right not too bed or too small, I'm not too sure if an A6 is needed, plenty of rear leg room and head room, even behind the drivers seat once I adjusted the drivers seat to my liking.

1236,"May  5, 2016  1:25PM",dino001,"Cadillac is a tragic case of a complete mismatch between aspirations and reality on many different levels. It all starts with pricing not matching the current perception (whether the perception is correct or not, doesn't really matter at this time), production capacity and sales network. They want to be ""prestigous"", but their production capacity and especially dealer network is a legacy of their heyday well before German and Japanese brands took over that market.  I read that Detroit's problem has always been (across the board for all brands) inability to scale down production to match current demand, which in turn made them incentive addicts. They essentially make a car and then try to sell it. Others often have mindset that they won't make a car until they have some evidence it's actually needed somewhere. It can be a real order (customer's or dealer's - BMW operates that way), deep market studies, or simple case of matching cars that sold (Japanese reportedly do it that way). In other words - they want to (at least virtually) sell the car before making it. Detroit makes it first (because you know, union contracts, sales targets, etc.) and then find a customer for it. Any attempt of changing that mindset, while positive in general long term, requires willingness of taking short or even longer lasting intermediate pain of sales drops, production shutdowns and contract breaks with minor dealers.  For comparison, Tampa Bay (not including Sarasota) has 3 BMW, MB, 2 Audi and 2 Acura, 1 Jaguar store, and only 4 Cadillac stores, which doesn't sound bad. But extend the radius to just 50 miles and the picture changes dramatically: it adds about one dealer for Sarasota for all Germans, one store in Lakeland for BMW and MB, but Cadillac's network grows to 13 stores. Considering sales numbers and it is clearly nuts. May be convenient, but there is no pricing power. I'm sure those dealers are hurting, too. This of course quickly rolls downhill into contentious relationships with customers, as dealer that doesn't have any money will not support their customer.  Cadillac's management keeps wanting to have the cake and eat it. They want large sales, no incentives and high prestige - we all know that ain't gonna happen. You can pick two. They probably know it, too - but their stakeholders are too entrenched and simply unwilling to take the necessary real steps to fix it - they rather pretend doing something and then act surprised that things are not going as planned.",germans detroits cadillacs correct japanese minor radius market jaguaruar bad term virtually im cake wont short rather rolls matching long taking complete nuts brands longer take 1 positive gon breaks 50 aint contracts intermediate dealer real across requires high simply words sarasota picture 13 sales aaudiempt act going changing really money planned levels whether sell 4 considering keeps prestige making studies many know hurting grows ddodgeatically doesnt least changes addicts aspirations made drops support large match audi simple especially subaru willingness bay scale even downhill eat deep bmw 3 mercedes starts took others demand cadillac na customers sound german order stakeholders operates want shutdowns makes lasting pick two numercedesers make comparison extend reality management stores mismatch lakeland inability case may detroit unwilling always often production targets including happen surprised entrenched incentive first heyday tragic perception store incentives well board tampa try read time different reportedly capacity things maaudier necessary essentially actually way union course pricing probably pretend cars etc general performance find relationships miles sure adds somewhere customer dealers current fix contract steps problem acura wanting turn something prestigous evidence one convenient sold contentious needed pain network car mindset 2 quickly clearly

1288,"February 14, 2016  4:48AM",roadburner,"Those of you who don't follow the Cars & Conversation or Chronic Car Buyers topics might be interested to know that I picked up a CPO 2014 M235i about two weeks ago. My wife insisted that I check it out; I originally intended to drive it first and then drive a couple of new Mustang GTs in the same general area. As it turned out I ended up making a deal then and there.  I was honestly surprised at how good it was. The car is about the same size as an E36, which suits me perfectly(a main sticking point on the Mustang was its size). It has just about every option save the the Helen Keller Package(Blind Spot Monitoring, Lane Departure warning, etc.). It's also an automatic, but being the Sport derivation of the ZF HP8 I can live with it(in any event, I still have the Club Sport and Wrangler to keep my left foot in practice).  What do I like? The transmission actually does what I want it to do in Sport+/Manual mode- every other BMW automatic I have driven has tried to second-guess me- including the B7 press loaner I tested a while back. Think: electronic full manual valve body, for any older drag racers out there. Durability should be decent as the M235i Racing gets essentially the same transmission, albeit with more aggressive software.  The Adaptive M Suspension literally transforms the car when you toggle into Sport or Sport+. It's almost like two different cars. I've never driven a BMW where the EDC or AMS made such a huge difference.  The standard M Performance Power Kit really eliminates the turbo lag; with 330 lb-ft of torque available from 1300 rpm it almost feels like some of the big block Chevys I drove in my misspent street racing youth. Fuel economy is hovering around 25 mpg, which is more than good enough for me.  Michelin PSS in a staggered setup are standard. No run flats!  The sports seats with adjustable bolsters are excellent as expected. It's no wonder that BMW NA is making them standard fitment in many US models; the base seats in newer BMW are only good for generating business for chiropractors.  The H-K audio is good enough that I don't feel like I have to tweak it right away.  Dislikes? The steering could use a bit more feel. That said, the effort and ratio(s)-Variable Sport Steering is standard-is very good.  I agree with Bob Harper fromBMW CAR : the IP needs oil and water temperature gauges instead of the ""///M 235i"" graphic that illuminates as soon as you open the driver's door  The brakes are great but the pedal feel is somewhat wooden.  No LSD. I will definitely have to add one sooner than later; at half throttle it will light up the rear tires in Comfort mode with DSC fully enabled.  Track time will have to wait a few months. The 2ers first outing will be at Putnam Park- which is my ""home"" track. I'm too old to attempt to learn a car and a track at the same time. It will also see at least one night at the local 1/8th mile strip- might as well test the Launch Control...  A couple of people asked me to compare it to the E30 M3; the 2er is not as light on its feet and it lacks the ""hard-wired to the synapses"" experience of the original M3. However, it is very comparable to the E46 M3 in terms of handling and braking. Power in contrast, is more akin to that of the E9x M3 at least from a usability standpoint on public roads. In any event, I can easily see keeping this car for a decade or more. Who knows when/if Munich will build anything RWD in this size class again?  So... Is it worthy of an ///M badge? I'd say it's closer to an ""is,"" but that said, most everyone has forgotten that the first M car based on a production model was the E12 M535i- which boasted the M30 3.5 motor from the E24 635i along with an upgraded suspension, an M body kit, and aggressively bolstered front seats.

I read the posts of folks who seem to research and often agonize over the new Audi they have or are about to order.  Then, as time passes, their new prize possessions arrive and they take pictures of their soon to be delivered rides -- they post them and seem to beam with pride about the new car they have acquired.  Next, pictures of the new cars in the owner's driveways or garages are posted -- and the captions on these pics are ""Let the Mods Begin.""  Later, the details of the aftermarket wheels, tires, engine management chips, breathing management aids and even brake rotors are detailed along with the window tinting expenses and, sometimes, even elaborate retrofitting of navigation systems to cars not factory equipped with nav systems are laid out, including the sometimes breathtaking costs required to add such features aftermarket.  In some cases the modifications involve the suspension systems, exhaust systems and underhood plumbing (for the super or turbo chargers) too.  The expenses seem to have no ceiling -- and as soon as one is completed, the next improvement is lusted after in print on the Audiworld forum for that particular model.  Often, so it seems, these mods exceed the costs of simply ordering the cars with the factory upgrade. I mean, really, I have seen folks mod their A4 SLines so much that they reach and sometimes surpass the MSRPs of the car so lusted after, the S4.  The mods that make the A4 have more power often will void the warranty. The S4, stock, comes with a very nice warranty.  Why buy a nearly $50K A4 and mod the crap out of it so that you have more than the cost of an unmodded S4 in it, knowing that the S4 is likely to outperform the modded A4?  Is the joy of modding the joy? If a stock S4 can be had for about the same cost as a modded A4 (which then loses its warranty) what in the wide wide world of sports would posses someone to do this?  BTW, I said, it takes one to know one -- but I must admit, my modding was limited to a chip put into an Audi turbo engine for a total cost well under $1000.

1545,"November  4, 2015  9:58PM",markcincinnati,"Why Drive ‘All-Wheel’ drive cars (that have automatic transmissions)?  Those of you who have, er, suffered through my 5,000+ posts over the past years know that I am an advocate for – some might even say obsessed with – quattro, X-drive, 4Matic, SH-AWD, 4Sure-4Sure, etc. drive trains. Several folks do adamantly oppose all-wheel-drive, favoring instead rear-wheel-drive (and only rarely favoring front-wheel-drive). Likewise some folks are seemingly violently opposed to any transmission that lacks a clutch pedal, regardless of the tonnage of empirical evidence suggesting some clutch-pedal-less models actually outperform those with a clutch.  Not long ago, I was one of the Luddites who bemoaned the death of the manual transmission cars – now, however, with both my physical skills and reading habits apparently still at peak performance, I hereby concede the 7-spd DSG transmission (and its shift programming and ability to ‘learn’) offered by Audi (and others) is superior to even the best 6-spd manual I’ve ever had the pleasure to have known.  But what I’m on about – in the majority – today is the darn near universal adoption of all-wheel-drive as either literally or virtually standard on the premium cars we opine about here: Acuras, Audis, BMWs, Cadillacs, Infinitis, Lexus, Mercedes and Volvos. As a practical matter, here in Cincinnati at least, it has become increasingly difficult to find just about any model from these manufacturers that aren’t ‘typically’ stocked almost exclusively in its AWD configuration. Cincinnati generally does not have much in the way of snowfall, so I find it hard to believe this phenomenon (the explosion of AWD premium vehicles) is unduly influenced by our winter weather (which produces some, but not much, cold and snowfall.)  The, um, ‘purists’ decry AWD’s weight penalty, added complexity and cost, and seem to associate the addition of AWD to a BMW (especially) or Mercedes (or Porsche) as akin to the brand publically emasculating itself with a rusty razor blade. To these folks, well, “It ain’t a purty sight,” to watch their beloved RWD stick shift wielding brands eschew everything that made them special.  Horse-hockey!  First off, let’s stipulate we’re (I’m) talking about the cars we can buy to drive on the public streets, roads and highways almost exclusively. This means I’m not going to presume you’re shopping for a new BMW or Cadillac or even Mercedes C class in the $50,000+ range so that you can drive (your new machine, your personal means of transportation for the things you do in your life) from the dealer to the race track or drag strip (if such things – ‘drag strips’ – have somehow managed to stay off of the politically incorrect list and, of course, still actually exist outside of an historical reference) as if such activities are de rigueur.  No, what I’m on about here is our everyday (and every weekend) cars – no matter that they may be some form of a Luxury Performance Sedan (brand and model) configuration.  In order, I say, you’re better off with (in order) an AWD, FWD and finally RWD vehicle – generally speaking. Yes, there are activities and (mere) moments where your beloved RWD may demonstrate its superiority over the other drive line configurations. But, from a practical perspective, RWD for most folks is the ‘least-best’ configuration if you actually buy your car to drive (principally, primarily – or virtually exclusively, that is), year ‘round on our public streets, roads and highways. Conversely, AWD is the best configuration you can employ to navigate our public streets, roads and highways.  Now, thanks to Bing and Google, it is possible to find apparently endless studies, tests, opinion pieces, essays and love letters for your favorite set-up. However, what does appear to be happening (again) is what was once (in the early 1980’s) referred to as the time between the parenthesis, the time between eras. In the context of both ‘Megatrends’ (the book I am referencing) and the number and location of a car’s driven wheels (and manual transmissions, to a lesser extent), ""[Some] are clinging to the known past in fear of the unknown future."" Believe it or not, over five years ago, in the March 24, 2010, edition of the Wall Street Journal it was written:  “Rear-wheel drive may not even be that important for some of BMW's new customers. Mr. Reithofer (then BMW AG’s chairman) told analysts. . .that BMW had a survey that found 80% of the customers for the BMW compact 1 series, which in Europe is sold mainly with four-cylinder engines, didn't know it was a rear-wheel drive car.”  The same 2010 article concluded: “The truth is that most drivers probably can't tell whether they are driving one kind of car or another. As technology narrows the performance differences, ""luxury cars don't have to be defined by which ends drive them.""  On-line comments posted in response to this article included:  ""I grew up driving RWD cars in the snowy mid-west. I can tell you FWD cars take all the fun out of winter driving. My first experience was with a rented Toyota corolla near Vail, CO. With a foot of fresh snow I was able to easily maintain 55 mph, with the car tracking like a champ. Any RWD car would have been in the ditch over 35 mph.""  And so it goes.  RWD may – but it is increasingly difficult to prove – offer that certain je ne sais quoi, a ‘quality or trait that cannot be described or named easily.’ But technology has virtually wiped out the recognizable differences and, I would argue, has – in the best configurations such as those offered by many premium auto manufacturers, literally wiped out the unrecognizable (some would call them measurable) differences.  Still, some (or many depending upon your bias) front-wheel-drive cars suffer, at least somewhat, from the reputation as being unexciting to drive.  Maybe, like so many other things (or everything else?), it’s all about ‘da money’ – FWD is cheaper to make, provides better packaging and can also provide lower emissions and higher MPG’s. Yet, with the apparently relentless increase in the up-take of AWD cars, CUV's and, of course, SUV's, that may not be true; it may be that the market [you and I] simply perceive AWD to be the best (and remember perception IS reality)!  Then, when the market (aka ‘you’) do finally get yourself to the point of either wanting better and better performance, or perhaps wanting the Ultimate Driving Experience, you end up in a top o’ the line 3, 5 or 7 series – with X-drive, natch.  Nothing even comes close to a fine fine German AWD sedan (as we discuss them here, classified as either ELLPS or LPS cars).  RWD (like the manual transmission) is rapidly becoming an historical footnote – far as I can tell, most Millennials have AWD or FWD vehicles and can’t even drive a stick.  Of course, if they're driving a DSG equipped car, they are almost certainly shifting better than you or I, on our best days, can shift a stick.  . . . and then you die.

1562,"October 24, 2015  1:34PM",markcincinnati," I think there are certainly many examples of products that are -- for whatever reasons -- equal to or even better than other products but the two products are in different classes. Let me give a non-auto example: Tissot makes/markets watches. These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost a fraction of other Swiss made time pieces. Breitling makes/market watches. These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost many multiples of ""similar"" Tissot time pieces.  It is possible to pick up a ""higher end"" Tissot with about every modern watch feature and function (complications) known to humans -- and the thing will cost hundreds of dollars (and is often discounted on top of that).  It is virtually impossible to pick up a ""lower end"" Breitling that has only a date a sweep second hand function for under $2,000. Far as I know they both will tell time equally well and both will last for decades, lifetimes even.  Tissots, even ones studded with diamonds, are not considered high-end watches. A watch super-store such as Tourneau sells Rolex, Movado, Tag and also sells Bulova, Seiko and Tissot -- if a Tourneau outlet is near you, check out the brands, perhaps you'll see what I'm referring to. The Rolex is to BMW as Seiko or Tissot is to the Genesis. The market perceives what it perceives. And in the instance of BMW vs Genesis like Rolex and Seiko, ""Perception is Reality.""  Dimensions, decibels at 70MPH, number of speakers in the sound system, suppleness of ride or even country of origin doesn't change -- or hasn't thus far changed -- the reality that the Genesis is not currently considered an LPS vehicle; indeed, it is also not, yet, considered an ELLPS vehicle.  It, the Genesis, is a ""cheap car that's really nice""[sic].  Similarly, the Toyota Avalon isn't a Lexus -- probably for the same perception reason. My feelings of consternation regarding the A3 vs the rest of the Audi lineup (or, similarly, the entry level Mercedes vs the other Merc's) still stands. Likewise: My belief that Tissot makes timepieces that equal Breitling's products, insofar as their ability to keep time, also stands -- but I don't for a minute think that Tissot or Seiko, etc, are high-end Premium watches.  Genesis' cars, no matter how feature laden, no matter how statistically similar, etc, are not in the same class as BMW's. The market's perception, not mine, not yours -- currently indicating BMW is LPS and Genesis is not -- is reality.  Maybe there will be a reversal of fortune for both of these successful companies -- thus far, there is scant evidence of that.

The S3 may feel rougher than an S4 (more on that below), but I would say it's much more refined than, say, a WRX. No doubt you're paying for that premium, but once you really load up a GTI, WRX or certainly a Golf R, the premium for the Audi gets much more palatable (at least it was for us).  Now, I was impressed enough with her S3 that I returned to the Audi dealership and bought my S4 a few weeks later.

In fact, and I posted this on the CCBA forum too, this S4 may be my favorite car I've owned. The balance between the sporty dynamic and luxury is impressive.

1588,"October 21, 2015  3:33PM",andres3," I just got my 35K mile service at 34K miles (did it early). I did it early mainly due to the fact I skipped/missed my 30K mile oil change. Don't listen to Audi if you plan on keeping the car a long time; best advice is change the oil every 5K miles no matter how good the oil is. If you plan on not keeping it much past the 50K warranty, then Audi's advice to do 10K maintenance intervals is sound. Otherwise, the best advice I've received is that it is not a good idea to skimp.  What did your 35K S4 service include?  I told them to include the engine air filter whether it said to do it or not. They also did my cabin air filter, the motor oil, and I asked for a front brake service including new fluid as my pads were starting to scratch metal on metal on 1/2"" ring just a week before my scheduled service (took two weeks to get into this shop from when I called; they are too good and popular and busy as a result!). Rotors when correctly priced even the large fronts were only $125 each, but still a hard pill to swallow twice now for me (due to track-use). This time, (unlike the first which was totally my fault for ignoring the sensor lights), I didn't get all the dummy light sensors warning me my pads were low; might need to ask Audi why the brake pad sensors didn't warn me and to pony up for the rotors as a result Also need to ask my shop again what the diagnosis/theory is for the failure of the sensors to warn me I was scoring my rotors with metal on metal contact. Perhaps the pads were unevenly worn from overheating during 100+ degree track days; causing the lack of warning. Need to follow up with them. My front pads are not really meant to be track abused more than probably 1 weekend (they were put through 2 as well as 19,000 miles).  CR came out with 2014/15 results of the most reliable Car brands, and Audi as real-world observance between you and I seems to agree with, is at the top of the chart along with a couple others for good reason.

I could be wrong, but I also assume there are people (and I have been one from time to time) who lurk, but don't post. Moreover, I also assume there are folks who may research (and dream about) their next vehicle using the manufacturer's web sites. The problem with doing that is that those sites are entirely marketing oriented -- there is nothing that could provoke ""other brand (and maybe even other model) thinking.""  This is one of the key benefits of participating in an Edmund's Forum -- you may be provoked.  One of the most popular classes of cars is the class that is discussed in this very forum, ELLPS -- but even within our ranks we differ on what is or is not EL (entry level). I often argue that EL pertains most to the basic chassis (grossly, the ""size""). This means a BMW 3 series, no matter how modest or how out there (in any way you wish to construe this) is an ELLPS car (meaning I would include an M3 unless or until some more granular classification is heartily adopted by folks who flock to Edmunds.)  I found it difficult -- but I acknowledge other's POVs -- to consider two Acura's, for instance, built on separate wheelbases/chassis to be candidates for ELLPS classification. Likewise, I have difficulty considering, again as an example, both the A3 and A4 offerings from Audi to be considered in the same class. Again, my rationale is more size (length and width, i.e.) derived than MSRP or HP or torque, derived. Also, I think a certain Premium-ness is required to be in this club.  Recently, there have been ""trial"" balloons loosed suggesting that the A3 family, now that there is an S3 available, merits inclusion in the ELLPS category. Folks [some] suggest that the acceleration numbers put forth by the S3, since they are a few tenths of a second less than that of an S4, render the S4 a good candidate to be passed over when one is shopping in the over $45,000 category. After all, a balls-to-the-wall S3 can be had for something in the $51,000 neighborhood and a maxed out S4 can command $10,000 more. Why bother paying more is the either stated or implied thought.  Having two late model Audis gives both my wife and me multiple chances to ""legitimately"" test-drive almost every car in the Audi lineup, since they are all in the loaner fleet. I may have mentioned my wife got to be the very first user of a 2016 A8L for 24-hours while her SQ5 was in for new shoes and an all-wheel alignment and oil+filter change. Last week, my turn came in the form of an A7 (which, I must say, I was underwhelmed with).  Couple these multiple legitimate test drives with the hobby test drives we repeat Audi customers are afforded, and you might be able to grant that the missus and I are very well qualified [amateur] Audi experts.  With this as a backdrop, I must tell you about yet another S3 experience we've had and the conclusions that can be drawn vis a vis the S4.

1609,"October 23, 2015  5:42PM",markcincinnati,"Being quicker to 60mph  There is a lot to like about the S3. There is a whole lot to like about the S3 if you've not driven an S4. The pricing of the S3 does seem, if you go to a dealer that has both S3's and S4's on the showroom floor, difficult to justify -- again if you've driven (or own, especially) a B8 S4 post 2012, for instance.  I found the S3 to be a bit quicker than the S4 (both cars are equally fast) -- or it felt that way, perhaps -- at the slow speeds. But the S4 with the DSG in ""S"" mode, does seem to be able to get things done in a more sorted, I would say ""better"" fashion; the S4 is noticably smoother and, yes, does things with a feeling that it does have more urge, than the S3. This may be a function of the extra gear, I dunno.  The S3 seemed to dart -- perhaps it seems to ""flinch"" when the wheel is turned. That reaction certainly is indicative of some level of responsiveness, but I did find the S4, even when set to dynamic mode, to be responsive without flinching.  The S3 felt light -- and that is a good thing. But when you close (er, slam) the doors on the S3 (vs the S4), the sound is slightly tinny, evoking some sense that I can only say reminds me of my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance: flimsy. Please note -- I am not saying the S3 is flimsy. It does ""sound"" decidedly less solid than the S4 when the doors are slammed however.  For short trips, the S3 was a blast to drive -- but on the frost-heaved Interstate highways we have here in SW Ohio, any speed less than 80 was choppy, harsh almost. In contrast the S4 at 70 over the same surface just feels solid and ""firm.""  The S4 at any speed under 100 (I couldn't get the real estate to get the S3 over 100 on our crowded Interstates here in Cincinnati) is quieter, one could almost call the S4 luxurious, smooth, supple, etc. The S4 feels like a premium car from just about any perspective I can think of -- while the S3 seems like every surface that you can touch is a bit thinner, hinting at being brittle, in fact. The S3 is made of good stuff, but the stuff feels a bit more economy class, than premium class, however,  The thing is, I do like the S3, but it almost seems like it should have been brought out first (in its present iteration) under the VW logo, rather than under the four-rings.  I took a second drive in a balls-to-the-wall equipped version of an S3 and found a drive around the interstate surrounding Cincinnati (I-275) to be almost punishing -- especially at any speeds under 80. The S3 is a modern day buck-board when equipped with the largest wheels/tires (in summer config) and with the Audi-Drive-Select set to Dynamic.  Yes it is a very high-end go-kart. And, to me, a very high-priced one at that.  My 2014 S4 has its faults -- and it was $57K+, nearly $7K more than the S3, that is -- but the S3 needs to go to finishing school to shed some of its harsher edges. Hell, it can even keep some of the ""boy-racer"" characteristics, since I am of the opinion that I don't want the S3 to be a substitute for an S4, anymore than I want the S4 to be a substitute for an S6.  The S3 may be -- in fact the statistics seem to say that it is -- quicker than an S4 (not faster, quicker), but I am not looking for Audi to produce a WRX or WRX STI (not that there is anything wrong with those Subaru models). I am looking for Audi to produce and market Premium and even perhaps Super-Premium Luxury Performance cars.  In some respects the S3 doesn't represent that ideal as much as the marketing materials proclaim.  If you have an S3 and love it -- I congratulate you and do understand how you could be justified in feeling that way.  This long-time Audi maven, however, thinks the S3 should be sent, IMMEDIATELY, to finishing school or that the price should be cut about 15%. Being quicker than an S4 just isn't enough.

1615,"October 23, 2015  7:25PM",markcincinnati," Point taken, but my sense is that the S3 was, much more of an economy class vehicle -- hence my remark that this freshman effort might have been better if it had come out from the VW side of the house. Even a sub-$50K S4 has a substantially more solid feel; and the look at the interior one enjoys and can touch and feel from behind the wheel is, well, Premium.  I like the phrase: ""cheap car that's really nice"" -- unfortunately, I can't say I thought the feel of the S3 was in keeping with the rest of the Audi lineup we get here in the US.  I read an article about the ways mfgrs approach cutting costs -- one of the mentioned ways was that a car company can elect to make the surfaces you see, but don't touch often, much thinner or with a lower grade of whatever material the surface is made of; also the ""glove box"" can be made of a cardboard like material and so forth.  The S3 seemed much more like every ""trick"" in the book to drive cost down was used, much moreso than the other Audis and BMWs we have had since 1977. My 2014 S4, by contrast simply feels more substantial.  Now, then, I have not seen the upcoming B9 A4/S4 family coming in 2016; and, it is possible, certainly, that it may have adopted the wring cost out ""attitude"" the A3 family seems to have embraced. If so, more's the pity.  Also, the new ""el cheapo"" economy Mercedes (below the C class) seems, too, like a cheapening of the brand.  For these companies, I would suggest they look at a similar (failed) attempt to bring out ""lower cost"" representations of the brand by BMW.  I think I, too, would rather have ""a cheap car that's really nice"".  Perhaps Mercedes can't bring out a non-Mercedes brand, ""economy car,"" but Audi, I think, should have brought out the A3 as a nicer VW than a not-as-nice Audi.  In our market, Toyota got it and came out with the Lexus brand, Honda the Acura brand and Nissan the Infiniti brand. For years, too, GM saw the market approach that seemed to work was to ""always have another brand to aspire to"" starting with Chevy and topping out at Cadillac. I understand the Buick Regal GS is a very competent, ""nice"", car -- but I also believe GM doesn't have, in the Regal, a Cadillac ATS clone.  When the accountants (so it was said) started to rule the day, we started seeing badge engineering -- and while platform sharing does make some sense, taken to extremes, it can also sound the death knell for a previously great brand. Does anyone here really care that Ford dropped Mercury a few short years ago? There was, really, nothing special about them compared to their virtual twin Ford models. There was a time, however, that Mercury was different, some would say special, more special than a Ford.  Lincoln is probably still on the endangered species list for similar reasons.

1624,"October 16, 2015  3:32PM",markcincinnati,"Here's another issue that Cadillac faces: The Auto Mall (AM).  You can go to the AM and in the space of a couple hundred yards (feet in some cases) you can see the Cadillac dealer, the Lexus dealer, the Lincoln dealer and the Ford, KIA, Chrysler/Dodge, Hyundai and Honda dealers. So, you test the Cadillac, then a couple of minutes later be behind the wheel of a new Infiniti or Audi or BMW if you want.  With the MSRP of the Cadillac so close to that of the Lexus or BMW, etc, and with the ability to almost literally test drive several brands on any given Saturday, Cadillac probably seems -- at this point -- to be overpriced or for whatever reason is undervalued.  I just returned from a 4-day trade show in Las Vegas (at Caesars) and after the day's end I would walk down to the Forum Shops at Ceasars. I found several high-buck watch stores and one that carries many high-buck brands and some less expensive brands, too.  Seeing these watches, I thought about the Cadillac as I looked at the Tissot watch collection and then the Movado watch collection after having looked at the Rolex and MontBlanc watches.  Tissot makes some very nice watches that don't require a second mortgage -- I'd take a Tissot over a Seiko any day. But, once we get to, perhaps, over $1,500 to $2,000, Tissots just seem overpriced. At that price I can move to Movado, but once I get to over $2,000 to $2,500 for them, I start to think, Tag, MontBlanc or even Breitling despite the price jump. Somehow, the $4,995 MontBlanc, although expensive, doesn't seem as expensive as a $1,795 Tissot or $2,995 Movado. The Tags, too, can soar in price, but they don't actually seem out of line, even at $6,995 or higher.  Cadillac, today, may be Movado, in some cases, however, it may be perceived as a high-end Tissot. For me, that means, if I'm going to pay THAT much for a Cadillac, I might as well get an Audi, BMW or Mercedes -- and if I am on a budget and want a bunch of stuff (high content), well a Genesis starts looking as good as the Cadillac and priced appropriately. Genesis is Tissot, but can make you believe you got the Movado.  Cadillac today can't quite pull of making you believe you got the BMW -- other than the price you are asked to pay.  I'm just not in the market for a $4,995 Tissot.  The malls may be a great place to shop efficiently, but when Cadillac is in the lineup, it just seems -- at this juncture -- overpriced.",point id somehow content market think dont ford 2500 im looking several auto jump asked brands take styling watches behind almost tissot great lineup dealer malls day forum although 2995 high mortgage returned going tags trade seem caesars thought see msrp reason las making many much stuff however cases doesnt another soar pay line veefficiency seeing couple juncture walk lexus kia test audi close literally 4day highend space nice bunch efficienacuray expensive start even perceived drive bmw rolex higher feet mercedes starts good new heres montblanc cadillac believe 4995 shop want makes show highbuck might less seiko pull carries make breiacuraing stores 2000 honda tag budget priced place ceasars may today hyundai undervalued whatever watch collection second well overpriced would perhaps minutes get mall chryslerdodge price hundred seems end appropriately yards days cant saturday later actually probably tissots etc infiniti require got found ability issue looked dealers go shops 1795 quite 1500 move one despite faces given means 6995 movado lincoln

1637,"October 17, 2015  4:13AM",markcincinnati,"Most of the leases from the car companies themselves are sub-vented. The thing is, part of the formula is based on MSRP -- and while the mfgr can inflate the residual and reduce the money factor, the issue of the MSRP still makes certain calculations limited in outcome.  The good news,so to speak, is that these severely sub-vented leases make it possible to have a 5 series for a mo pay that one would think appropriate for a 3 series.  We did buy my wife's SQ5 and leased my S4; I put nothing down. As she approaches 50K miles she finds she cannot CPO the car, but can buy Audi extended mntce. I, on the other hand, can have my car CPO'd and buy the extended mntce. I'll have both low payments and a 100K warranty and prepaid mntce to 85K. By then I'll own the car outright and likely have been under mntce and warranty the whole time with a payment less than my wife's 66 month finance (which did require a down payment).  It is getting somewhat difficult to come up with a scenario where buy and hold is as attractive as lease and dump.  Our plan, unless new information changes things, is for me to buy my S4 off lease and for her to trade the SQ5 prior to 100K miles.  You know, my company just pays X amount every month for our IBM iSeries computer -- and every so often we get an upgrade to a newer faster bigger model.

I'd appreciate a URL if anyone here knows of one.  I mentioned this before -- and it did have to do with a GM car in the spirit of full disclosure -- but my neighbor with 80K on his somewhat late model ""paid for"" Pontiac Bonneville was, according to him, making maintenance and repair payments that were not too far below his financing payments. He went ahead and got a new big-boy Dee-Lux CUV (Chevy) using the logic that if he was going to make payments on a crappy, unreliable, old car, why not make the same payments and be driving a new car with a warranty.  He also bought a super-nice Ford four door pickup truck (with what darn near looks like a car interior, only nicer) -- and plans to keep it until the wheels turn square. Perhaps Ford trucks are really hard to kill or wound.  Took my S4 in for the 35K service interval + a tire rotation last Thursday night; got an A7 with 5K miles on it; car was apparently a base model with 19"" wheels, winter package (F/R heated seats, steering wheel) and LED headlights. For all intents and purposes, the window sticker I found in the glove box bottom lined at $69K. The option packages did not include the upgraded sound system, but, oddly Nav and voice command and BT communications and WiFi hotspot were all included. It also had premium paint (a kind of crystal black). Perhaps Premium+ doesn't merit a separate line item (which I thought odd, since there was an A6 Prestige on the showroom floor).  The A7 was sublime -- library quiet, supple, smooth -- the thing oozed from point A to point B. As Col Potter once said, ""there aren't enough O's in smooth to describe it."" Of course he was talking about some very old scotch whisky as I recall.  The upgraded wheels and tires (with all-season designation) were probably on the car for styling purposes since the car lacked the sport suspension option. But I hoped the A7 would be a true Luxury Performance Sedan -- especially for nearly $70K.  In a straight line and at triple digit speeds, the car was, to repeat, sublime. However, I really could not find much of that German Taught feel I assumed would be present. Oh hell, the thing seemed very close to mushy, with ample body roll and, despite quick turn-in, a huge tendency toward understeer at any slightly above posted limits upon entering a curve or twisty section of highway.  I had been, previously, loaned an A6 with all of the sport option boxes checked off and it seemed much much better than the A7.  The thing sure was purty however -- but not nearly $10K more beautiful than a comparable A6 -- and driving it although not exactly a chore, was, hmm, rather a disappointment.  I was able to pull into the dealer in the A7 and five minutes later drive out in my S4 -- the main straight line difference was that the S4 is not quite as quiet as the A7, but everything else about the S4 -- from the sound system to the sound of the engine at full cry -- was superior.  Now, then, however, would I have the need to drive myself and 3 passengers on a 100 mile trip to Columbus, Louisville or Indianapolis, well the extra rear seat leg room of the A7 would be appreciated.  I guess the S cars have the power to spoil (me at least). I simply would not pay the extra $13K for a relatively stripped A7 -- and if they were both $57K, the S4 would still be my first choice.

1679,"October  8, 2015 10:22PM",dino001," Small additions/corrections:  1. Only BMW price is negotiable, others are set by manufacturer. In other words, BMW uses exactly the same invoice-to-retail scheme, just at lower levels. I think the difference comes from BMW using dealer same way to purchase the vehicle, whereas others may be using their dealers only to handle the paperwork (and purchase is direct from them). 2. BMW 7% (now going to 5%) discount on both invoice and retail price applies ONLY to the base price of each line (e.g. 328i, 335i, 535ix, etc.). All options (such as metallic paint, premium pack, nav, etc.) are priced at same level as US delivery. Destination charge (BMW loves advertising ""from"" without inclusion of those $900+, like we actually had an option of not paying it - I really hate that, it's unseemly) is also full US level, no discount. This makes the ""blended"" discount closer to 5.8-6.5% for more heavily optioned vehicles - now it will be just about 4-4.5%. 3. BMW DOES NOT include hotel stay, only transportation from the airport to the hotel downtown, or directly to BMW Welt. 4. BMW will feed you over the course of the day at BMW Welt in their cafeteria and you also get a talkien 20 euros credit or so in their restaurant (won't cover full meal, but will be OK to buy something with it). 4. X-models are made in the US for the entire world, thus are not eligible for ED. 5. I think Porsche may actually have a surcharge on the price, but I'm not sure about it.

You negotiate with the dealer where you hit within that spread. Values strongly depend on markets - some dealers don't even want to hear about discounting from ED MSRP (following theory of always preferring selling a unit from the lot rather than one not built yet). Unlike US deliveries, ED vehicles are not subject to allotments, training fee, or some other fees BMW may charge the dealers.

So, once they have such inventories, they used large amount of capital and are paying interest for the financing, rent for the location, upkeep, electricity. The calculus changes - instant sell of a car from the stock means no more interest paid and more working capital for the next unit. Essentially, the incentives and motivation reversed in favor of the stock.  Upscale brands are straddling between those big volume stores, where if you say ""order"" you have them running from you screaming bloody murder, and uberluxury, where virtually every car is ordered (like Rolls Royce).

1713,"September 24, 2015  1:37PM",markcincinnati,"One of the key comments -- and one that I agree with -- is that the advantages that diesel (engines) have over gasoline is/has diminished. The thing is, do we know how much we've seen the gasoline engines catch up with the diesel?  Clearly forced induction and small displacement engines have contributed to this. Now, or at least it would be fair to say ""soon"" we will have the ability to synthesize ""gasoline"" from termite (well sorta) waste and we just keep finding more and more ways to extract energy from the planet in many forms, including natural gas and shale, etc.  I saw another TV show -- which of course means it's true -- that said something to the effect that we have about 99 years worth of traditional fuels -- that we know of -- available to us (at present rates of consumption) in the US.  In 99 years, or even 59 years, I would assume we'll find ways to manufacture or harvest or extract energy from sources that today are too expensive or from sources that we currently aren't even aware of.  Perhaps diesel is done -- but, isn't it true that diesel contains more energy per drop and has (historically) been some 33% more efficient than gasoline. Moreover, with filters and converters and adblue, haven't we reduced pollution? Of course, perhaps this event will mark the turning point for the love affair Europe has had with diesel and the surging love affair Americans have started to have with it.  With the claimed ability to manufacture fuels from bio-substances (garbage, not food, hopefully) and with the claims that we will be able to figure out how to make fuel from water and make it affordable, maybe we've breathed new life into the internal combustion engine.  With respect to the ""reason"" for the lie postulated as ""VW didn't want their cars to have less pep and less MPGs if they had made the cars pollute less, it seems like a reason that still doesn't make sense.  The engines, mostly, where this cheat was perpetuated were the VW and/or Audi 2.0L, correct? Wouldn't it have been possible to apply the pollution corrective measures on a 2.2L engine to keep up the HP and torque and perhaps suffer an MPG or three drop?  Again, this seems like a pressure cooker left alone with the heat on high -- it was only a matter of time before the thing would blow up (spraying beans all over the place). How could anyone think this cheat would not be discovered? I guess I am amazed that it took this long for the ruse to be brought to the light of day.  So now these folks are all getting fired. My take is the people who ordered the cheat and the folks who were in a position to blow the whistle and didn't ought to face some PERSONAL consequences beyond being fired (with some kind of generous exit package one would imagine). Perhaps a ""programmer"" who wrote the lines of code could be spared, perhaps. But the programmer's manager who told him/her to write the code, should be in a ""you are personally liable"" position at least somewhat.  Did the board know?

This dealer group has the Audi dealership and the Cadillac dealership within a few hundred yards of each other.  I did test drive, among other things, a Cadillac CTS when I was shopping for my new 2012 and 2014 cars. I was actually impressed with the CTS, but thought is was, er, mushy compared with the taught German and Japanese cars in the over $50K price range. I did think that once the suspension was recalibrated that the Cadillac could be a real contender. Cadillac must've thought so too, since the pros all seem to fawn over the ATS and CTS cars (appropriately optioned).  So, as I overtook what looked like a ""fake"" CTS this morning, I half expected it to be a kit car -- you know a CTS overlay on top of a LaCrosse or something even worse.  Yikes!  It was a new CTS with a ""Landau"" roof and a bunch of chrome and ""gold"" bling. I assumed this car was a joke foisted upon someone for some unknown and sick reason.  As I pulled next to the driver -- an apparently older American (remember I am one myself) -- I became so mad at the dealer, not the driver, for making this CTS tacky by any 2015 standards I can think of. Can you imagine any Audi, BMW or Mercedes dealership gold plating the brightwork of one of their cars, let alone putting a fake leather roof cover on it? What's next coach lights?  I thought this kind of tackiness was perhaps at least a decade+ behind us.  Are there no ""rules and regulations"" that Cadillac dealers must comply with? I mean it is one thing to see a new Camry or Accord so, er, adorned, in fact, I expect Camry's to be tackily dressed.

1739,"September 22, 2015 10:08PM",markcincinnati,"I've been reading and watching the TV biz channels as they pontificate on the meaning of all of this stuff. The current news is that this is a re-run; Cadillac did it (got fined) Ford did it, etc. Apparently 11M (VW's numbers) vehicles had this software installed. Well, Honda got caught a few years back -- same thing.  The list of ""who's done it"" seems to be much bigger than the current scandal.  This doesn't forgive any company -- and it is more serious than Hyundai fudging the MGPs of their cars or Acura claiming their cars had more HP than could be tested, and so on -- but the thing is, I have read (in car magazines) interviews, over the years, from top car company executives who have claimed the MPG and emissions requirements go ""to the practical limit"" of technology then go beyond what is known to be capable for any realistic sum of money.  Nothing said here is meant to forgive the lie.  However, isn't it possible -- in the current climate -- to find some ""objective"" engineers and/or scientists who could say ""here is what we are able to do TODAY at this price; here is what we're able to do TODAY at that price,"" and so forth. I understand if a Martin Winterkorn goes before ""the government"" and says ""this is what is possible at a cost of $xxx per car; and what you want us to do would cost ($xxxx) per car"" the government doubts the veracity of the remarks.  So, the government wants a car to emit this much pollution and go this far on a gallon of fuel (or whatever is used to power the vehicle); apparently it can't be done at a market acceptable price today. Then you factor in that CAFE often gives a pass to trucks, so the mfgr goes ahead and creates a 2-cylinder car with a cardboard back seat, no sound insulation and made with the lightest weight materials -- that are inexpensive -- known to the designers.  I guess it is possible to increase the EPA ratings in all of the good ways by making cars out of carbon fiber and unobtanium, and powering them with a fuel cell and a solar sail -- but, said cars will cost 300% of the traditionally built autos. So, you're $25,000 car will satisfy the EPA, etc, but, it will cost $75,000.  This, if at least in spirit is correct, is unworkable and for most folks unaffordable.  Again, this does not forgive lying, but I can only assume that the corporate thought process, since it keeps happening over and over, arrives at the conclusion that the cost of getting caught is less than the cost of [attempting] compliance. Since the cost of compliance is apparently, like unobtainium, simply too high to adopt.  Too big to fail? Who knows if VW is too big to fail -- but if the death of the VW enterprise is the eventual cost of this transgression and disregard for law, well, ""who's next?""  I would hope the regulated, rather than lie, make a convincing, compelling case in response to unreasonable and/or unaffordable legislative requirements.  Here is what I want: a car that accelerates to 60 in 3 seconds, gets over 75MPG, tops out at 155MPH, stops from 70MPH in 100 feet, holds 5 people and their luggage and costs $25,000. I have to assume this is like the old saw: you can have this product or service: fast, of high-quality or inexpensive -- pick two.

1746,"September 23, 2015 12:32PM",markcincinnati,"I am sitting here watching a TV show on the subject of the cost to make the cars in question compliant with their claims. The ""expert"" (I have no idea who he is, but he does not appear to be, currently at least, from a car mfgr), claims something like the cost per car to make them compliant is over $35,000 PER CAR. I don't even know of any Jettas that, new, retailed for that much.  Anyone who reads and/or watches conventional media knows that so many of these companies that try to get away with things, don't. Therefore, someone who measures risk must have come to the conclusion that the risk (cost) of the lie is lower than the risk (cost) of compliance. Why else would someone make such a decision, especially if the cost per car would be $200 or $300 as suggested here elsewhere?  Another news story claims, that ""as a practical matter,"" (which I assume is code for ""the cost of meeting the standards would make the cars in question unsellable"") there is no CURRENT way to meet these requirements.  Sure, discoveries are made every day, and I think it is reasonable to conclude that it is possible to get to zero emissions -- but diesel engines must make things more difficult and/or prohibitively expensive.  If I thought I could comply and simply pass the cost along to a willing market, why would I risk even the possibility of being caught fudging the numbers?  Something doesn't add up -- I mean why would Cadillac have done the same thing a few years ago, why would the other companies fudge HP or MPG ratings or not fix ignition switches (and in the case of ignition switches there was an inexpensive fix)?  I understand there are EPA haters, and of course there are car company haters, but time and again, when it is possible for a secret or cover up to be discovered, it is -- is, for example, Martin Winterkorn, a boob someone who doesn't read or watch TV where it is possible to see a peanut company exec go to jail for 28 years for trying to cover up tainted peanut butter, or GM being called out for faulty ignition switches or Cadillac being fined for cooking EPA compliance records?  Said it before, the only way to keep a secret between 3 people is if 2 of them are dead. How many people at VW knew? Did it not ever occur to anyone that a curious guy from the university of West Virginia (or where ever) would test one of these cars and uncover the deceit?  As somewhat of a student of Adam Smith, I'm not really sure if this is the invisible hand at work -- it seems more like the work of a statistician who advised (ill-advised, I'd say) management that the cost of compliance is far more dear than the cost of getting caught cheating.  I just missed what the President of Nissan was just saying in an interview, but it seems to be something like ""we all do it, because the costs of compliance are too dear.""

It seems like some people within VW thought the US rules were BS and didn't want to follow them. They wanted their cars to have better performance and better mpg by running their diesels ""naturally."" But the result was that the vehicles put out 5-40 times the pollution that they were allowed to by law.

The agency tests about 15 percent of the new cars that go on sale each year, but it simply doesn't have the resources--in staff or in funds--to test every new car.  It's worth noting that in the wake of fuel-efficiency rating reductions by Hyundai and Kia, and then by Ford (twice), the EPA has said it will step up its verification and may require manufacturers to confirm their lab results with on-road testing.

We super slabbed it to CDG, nice thing about France is speed limit is 130Kph, which is about 80, But like any country people travel faster then that. I averaged 90mph. We arrived at CDG at 130pm, got he car washed, (US customs requires the car to be ""clean."" there is a carwash at CDG, 8 euro later car was clean. Now, if you have been to Paris you know he city is horrible to drive in, and the French are just crazy drivers (really look at their cars), however, the route I programmed took us to the outside of Paris and missed most of the traffic. About 30 minutes before getting to the airport, the windshield cracks, I did not hear a rock or something hit it. Luckily the insurance on the car (that BMW pays for) will replace it. We get to the drop off location of the car, sign the necessary paperwork, and we are done, we say good by to the car, wont see her for at least 2 weeks. Total 3127 K driven on this vacation.     Yes, there is a crack if you look in the middle of the photo     Farewell photo...    The Euro plates will stay on the car when it arrives at the Dealer, and the Dealer been instructed to leave the front plate on (AZ does not require a front plate.)  This trip was about bucket list items, so another one was to take the Eurostar to London, the company that we dropped the car off took us to Gare du Nord train startion which is in the heart of Paris, it was an interesting drive.. We made it in 40 minutes, lets just say the French just do not care who they piss off. We bought the tickets at the train station, and was on board minutes later, we got the last two seats together facing forward. When we got on the train, there was this french women sitting in one of our seats, the business class trains are set up with single seats on one side, and two seats on the other, the two seats are set up to seat facing each other, so two people facing the direction of travel and the other are not. We we arrived, in her very broken English she wanted us to take the other seats, we said no. We knew from the seat map when we bought the tickets 3 people were sitting here, not 4. Come to find out, she decided she didn't like her single seat, plus a friend of her was on the train and wanted our seats. so they can sit together. Now the other passenger arrives (older lady), then the cabin attendant. The single rider (older lady) sits where the young women was to have sat, but she was refusing to move, and wanted us to sit in the other seats. Rick doesn't like traveling backwards. We tell the cabin attended this and we wanted our original seats, the young women speak french (but I think she speaks English too) to the cabin attended, so we end up in this circle of language, I think look at the young women, and said, I knew you speak English, so stop playing games. I was right, she did, so she understood everything I was saying, which really pissed me off. So I told her that we wanted our seats we reserved, if she didn't like then go find another compartment to ride in. She refused to move, needless to day, she won to a point, we were just moved to the Business Select Premium cabin... Like I said before of the French, We can do this because we are French.. It's the attitude that really piss's me off.. Europstar trains and dirty, they are getting new trains, I hope they have WIFI...  We arrived in London about 7pm, Ricks friends picked us up and took us out to dinner, then to our hotel.  Conclusion  The whole trip we talked about how this car will invoke memories as long as we have it.

The timing, for me, would be calendar 2017 at the earliest, but sometimes Audi shoots itself in the foot (if you ax me) by delaying the really fun cars for at least a year. Of course, I just read there will be an RS3 coming, with 350 HP, etc, which makes me wonder if folks will look at a 356 HP S4 and shop it against the RS3.  Presumably, the S4 will be longer and wider, so perhaps the size, not the HP will mitigate and dilute the temptation to cross shop. Or perhaps the RS3 will be priced out of reach compared to the S4. Now, then, this makes me wonder if Audi may think it needs a non-avant RS4 to go up against BMW and Mercedes high zoot models (now that the RS5 is gone).

1808,"September 16, 2015  6:48PM",markcincinnati," With all due respect and a showing of [my own] ignorance, I wonder what driveability issues are you referring to?  Given that both hardware and software components are in a state of constant revision, I can share some observations from the perspective of one who has a 2014 SQ5 (8-speed Tip) and a 2014 S4 (7-speed DSG) in captivity.  The programming of the Tip makes it the best iteration of the ""slush"" transmission -- as someone called it -- I've ever driven. The DSG is the smoothest transmission I've ever driven in that, when left in auto shift mode, the shifts are basically heard, not felt. I know the transmission has up-shifted by ear and by virtue of the drop of the tach needle, but the progression in feeling is unlike traditional torque converter auto transmissions and unlike manual transmissions. Both the Tip and the manual transmissions have a momentary disruption of forward momentum when the transmission decides to shift or when the driver depresses the clutch -- watching from the side, when either one of these transmissions is up-shifted, the heads of the driver and a front-seat passenger are momentarily ""thrown"" forward at the moment of the depression of the clutch or up-shift of the auto -- there is no such throwing or lurching with the DSG -- in fact in that ONE aspect, I would think the DSG could be said to be somewhat like a CVT. Somewhat, not much, but a little ""somewhat.""  Downshifting, again, is an area where the DSG excels -- when in full auto-mode ""S""port shifting program, the DSG transmission rev matches to the imminent downshift and the ""second"" clutch engages with virtually no kick. Only a manual transmission even comes close to this, but having said that, the DSG is so much smoother on a rev-matching down shift it isn't even close.  Now, I've driven the S4 (DSG), SQ5 (Tip) and S6 (DSG) equipped cars -- of the three, two of them are just that little bit better in terms of their shifting prowess and smoothness. Again, with all of the above subtleties stated for the record, it is apparent that someone at Audi (or whoever writes the software) has done everything they can to make virtually all of the ""dead giveaways"" that you are driving a Tip as invisible and imperceptible as possible. In short, unless you're really looking for HARD EVIDENCE that the SQ5 isn't a DSG, you might not really notice the SQ5 is not a DSG. Over time and with the availability (as I have) of two very very similar cars to drive back-to-back for comparison, well, you probably would be able to discern the subtle differences between the DSG and the Tip.  At this stage of my own posterior meter, I can tell the difference between the DSG and the Tip -- the Tip, NOT the DSG has some hint of drivability issues and even placing the Tip in ""S"" all of the time doesn't completely wipe out the ever-so-slight shift hesitation and shift lurch behaviors, although you really have to be paying attention to notice them.  I have not (yet) driven an RS7 -- frankly because I just don't think it is worth $120,000 (even if I had millions in the check book to do with as I please). I also don't think an S7 is worth $10,000 more than an S6 just for the body style. But I'm also the guy who resents an extra charge for ""paint"" beyond gloss black or gloss white.  I bring the RS7 up, not to reveal my proclivities and, er, cheapness for things such as pearl paint colors, but to remind anyone who needs to know, that Audi puts the very specially programmed 8-speed Tip in the RS7. Several reviews of the car noted their assumption that the RS7 transmission was another very fine implementation of the DSG; and, then, noting later in their review how virtually imperceptible the Tip is from the DSG as executed in the RS7.  Under full throttle in dynamic mode, both our S4 and SQ5 are prodigious accelerative forces of nature -- both of them emit the joyful ""PHLTTTBBB"" (aka fart sound) upon up-shift and when in S mode have quick paddle shift moves (but paddle-shifts are just a smidge quicker in the DSG, however).  Again, were the Audi folk to gift me (fat chance) a 2017 MY S4 Prestige 8-speed Tip with a torque vectoring rear differential and with red leather seats, I would be a happy man. Of course, this is based on my assumption that the hardware and especially the shifting software of the 2017 S4 Tip had continued to move it even closer to the characteristics of a DSG (which appears to be the programmers goal).  I have heard that the BMW implementation of the dual-clutch auto did indeed have driveability issues -- but I have only heard that the Audi and Porsche implementation and programming of the DSG have few, if any, critics.  What are the Audi DSG transmission issues?  And, why, if the DSG is not a fun, friendly transmission for daily driving, do they (the mfgrs) keep making the programming of the Tip versions as close to the feeling of a DSG as possible?",ive whoever dont phlauditbbb virtually im issues either review disruption auto forward showing performance lurching giveaways dead guy 120000 really dsg doesnt another progression audi ever joyful book needle resents even throtacurae style everything done makes friendly man engages aspect s7 moment comparison backtoback 7performance hyundai passenger discern would executed subacurae things frankly later cars basically hardware subacuraeties 10000 red constant smoother move nature gloss beaudier like dynamic apparent area hint momentarily smidge stage closer performance paddle feeling short happy aaudiention several equipped quicker characteristics noted versions although observations driven indeed needs reveal shifting making matches clutch specially tip ignorance drive progdodgemed terms vectoring goal full sound please check two availability accelerative revision said forces wonder converter components well body time folk momentary imperceptible isnt frontcomfort momentum posterior performance revmatching course state upshift throwing 2014 porsche bit shift pearl unless noting cheapness millions based car called hesitation comes mode watching driving progdodge eversoslight ear perspective litacurae mfgrs youre performances notice shifts difference styling behaviors share fat software reviews similar drivability side prestige drop much imminent iteration differences downshifting downshift someone bmw fart upshifted stated depression driveability make progdodgeming left 8performance critics moves beyond second invisible stylings somewhat virtue implementation probably aspiration felt tach er quick rear record dualclutch evidence driver slush hard think fine progdodgemers comfort completely looking smoothness chance possible continued could worth secadillac keep extra paying differential able appears proclivities rev due wipe heads know traditional however automode respect black referring gift upon close aka especially performance writes emit smoothest white prowess tell assumption daily might yet kick lurch performance prodigious paddleshifts heard three anyone saudi placing fun captivity fact puts meter remind bring decides depresses 2017 one also thrown charge given unlike
1809,"September 16, 2015  9:54PM",andres3," I'd agree that Audi's implementation of DSG is spectacular both in 6-speed form in my '06 A3 (they mastered this 9 years ago at least), and in the 7-speed iteration of my S4. In D mode the S4 is smoother and more ""auto"" like than in the A3. To me, the tiny bit of lurching when coming to a stop is normal, I'm used to it, expect it, and don't notice it at all as such. I have heard that Audi did get some complaints with the early DSG's for not being very ""auto-smooth"" like. People didn't seem to understand it behaves more mechanical, more connected, and that it is a good thing as it is more like a manual in that sense. I don't mind feeling the shift under power.  I'm afraid this change has nothing to do with drive-ability or consumer feedback, but simply a bean counter telling Audi they can make xxx $$$ more per car by using a cheap transmission rather than the best but pricey DSG. This bean counter is in for a rude awakening when sales plummet. The new R8 gets Audi's best dual clutch transmission, so they have figured out how to make it work in very high HP and torque heavy monsters.  I think the review above comparing the very good 8-speed auto to DSG will echo a lot of other people's reviews of the ZF-8 speed tiptronic. It is good, but not quite as good as DSG. Progress going the wrong direction. Perhaps the mid-cycle refresh will correct the mistake, or it is Audi's way of raising the carrot to make people purchase the RS4 to get the right transmission.",autosmooth correct people id think counter dont notice im telling xxx sense feeling review refresh complaints rather auto monsters work lurching performance wrong cheap zf8 simply high reviews form sales going seem dsg spectacular 06 bean normal progress least early stop didnt clutch iteration audi r8 plummet performance tiptronic raising good new right toyota purchase heavy gets midcycle coming driveability rude comparing make years 8performance performance understand afraid 7performance dual heard feedback carrot agree used dsgs direction mind perhaps per get awakening figured 9 performance way pricey implementation aspiration change performance behaves ago bit shift lot nothing tiny quite mastered smoother consumer 6performance like thing expect mistake mechanical connected performance peoples car mode using

As others have pointed out, shifts are imperceptible, other than from an audible standpoint, which I liked. Now, I haven't been the biggest fan of it in some of our other cars (TT, A3), but I thought the particular application in the S4 was outstanding.  At the end of the day, I made my decision based on ""one last go"" with the manual. I appreciate that Audi still offers it on the outgoing model, and thought I'd take advantage of it. That was a significant reason why I don't have too much heartache over buying a model that I knew would be replaced in the short-term.  I suspect the manual won't be offered on the new model. When the S3 isn't offered with it, and they just took it away from the R8, I can't imagine why Audi would choose to offer it on the S4.

1818,"September 18, 2015  8:28PM",markcincinnati," breld:  One can only hope you are correct. The DSG, of course, that I would expect would be the latest and greatest 7-speed DSG such as is offered as the optional (to the manual) transmission on the current S4. The press releases I have seen and have translated, however, claim the S4 will have the 8-speed Tip. Current A4 2.0T models come with the 8-speed Tip, but NOT the DSG 7-speed. Now, then, however, therefore, notwithstanding:  The current iteration of the S3 ONLY comes with a DSG transmission -- a 6-speed version. I assume there are factors that impact what is and what can be, but I have to assume the 7-speed DSG is heavier than the 6-speed DSG. What I don't know is if the 8-speed Tip is lighter than the 7-speed DSG, however.  I see no logic (marketing logic, which is as opposed to 'real' logic) in Audi offering US customers the A4 with a 6-speed DSG since most of the A4's sold in the US the past few years have been 8-speed Tips. I assume the number of takers on FWD A4's in the US is quite small, so for practical purposes, I will exclude them from my following remarks.  Many of those in the market (for an Audi A4) for the first time, are probably cross shoppers, shopping against BMW, Mercedes and perhaps even Acura, Infiniti and Lexus. In a world where ""more is better,"" I can only assume a new Audi A4 will receive a ding if it doesn't offer at least as many speeds as the cars it competes with. BMW 3's will soldier on with 8-speed ZF sourced transmissions, Acura will have, what, a NINE speed transmission? Mercedes 7-speed, Infiniti 7-speed, who knows if Lexus will, for the 2017 MY offer 6, 7, 8 or more speed automatics -- they've been having 6-speed units on the AWD versions and 8-speeds on the RWD cars, so, perhaps they have or will soon be upgrading to all 8-speeds or, who knows even more speeds?  The new shopper will HAVE to consider number of gears as a data point and if, for some reason, Audi chose to offer 6-speeds (DSG or not) while the other guys had 7, 8 or 9 speed units, I would think there would be some logic to the buyer saying, ""MORE is BETTER, so Audi is now not at the top of my list.""  I have not seen any evidence, and boo hoo (no sarcasm), it certainly appears that the DSG 7-speed will no longer be offered on the B9 Audis.  The only good news is that the 8-speed Tiptronic hardware and most especially software does continue to improve by imitating the DSG via a very expertly developed shift program. Said it before, I'm at least OK with the 8-speed Tip since it remains the best torque converter automatic I've yet driven.

1820,"September 18, 2015 10:18PM",markcincinnati,"My 2₵: The Value of Allure  Our “highways” – well not all of our highways, roads and streets – used to be something most of us looked forward to embarking upon in our cars – even in what for most of us in hindsight were piece-of-crap cars; e.g., my first car – one of mom and dad’s two cars – was an early ‘60’s vintage VW beetle (the thing didn’t even have a gas gauge). Shortly after I got my license and had pretty much resigned myself to driving a 36HP stick shift car with a fabric sunroof and AM radio and a sort-of heater, dad traded ""up"" (?) for a Plymouth Valiant with a slant-6 engine and a “three on the tree” stick shift (and first gear was not synchronized). This four-door “babe repellent” also had an AM radio, but it was also equipped with factory A/C – which seemed odd for an otherwise stripped of all creature comforts vehicle.  I loved these cars – I knew they were pieces-of-crap, but I blocked that from my thoughts since these cars gave me freedom, tunes (on the AM) and what felt like unlimited mobility to drive from my bucolic and very sleepy, very little town (pop. 2,700 assuming everyone was home) north of Dayton, Ohio, to the big city (Dayton, if you’re wondering is still just barely a city in my opinion). Truth of the matter is that I rarely needed to drive the 50 mile round trip to Dayton, nor could I regularly afford the 50₵ worth of Clark’s premium gas (Clark only sold premium gas at that time, if you’re wondering) required for such an adventurous outing.  Today, in contrast, our highways and byways now no longer symbolize [much] freedom, rather they are often seen as barriers to freedom:  “Well I left my job about 5 o'clock, it took fifteen minutes go three blocks, Just in time to stand in line with a freeway looking like a parking lot. Damn this traffic jam, how I hate to be late, it hurts my motor to go so slow. Damn this traffic jam, time I get home my supper'll be cold, damn this traffic jam.”  James Taylor  When my 16 year-old-self got behind the wheel, it was darn near magical, the car was a mechanical being, to be sure, but somehow I was able to anthropomorphize my steed (really, a 36HP VW Beetle was a steed, no kidding) – it became an extension of me, I was no longer driving a machine, I was driving art, it was so cool it was hot. Crank up the single-speaker AM radio until it distorted and back off the volume a quarter turn and carefully balance the “tone control” to pump out all the bass that piece-of-crap speaker could muster.  Everything was possible.  Now, I have to admit, as much as the VW Beetle was not exactly a babe magnet, well the Valiant was truly a babe repellent, even though I figured out how to double clutch the thing to make certain I didn’t “grind a pound” every time I shifted to first-gear. Even so, the Valiant still represented possibilities and made promises to me (that it virtually never kept, I must admit).  Still, everything was possible (in cars).  Sundays, dad always would say “Let’s go for a little ride”. Off we’d go: Mom, dad and me in the other family car, the ’63 Chrysler Newport with push-button transmission, power steering and power brakes and both front and rear AM radio speakers. This one had aftermarket A/C even though dad bought it brand new from the next not-as-little town over Chrysler-Plymouth dealer. Ah, a big V8 and torsion-quiet ride, big whitewalls, bias-ply tires and full wheel covers – chrome everywhere – bling! Someday this will be mine I thought.  This car would be a babe magnet, I was sure of it.  Today, some of us, probably most of us, have lost that sense of possibility when we get behind the wheel, after all most Americans are getting into appliances, machines that simply cannot be anthropomorphized; and we’re getting to roads that allow movement like a pig through a python. In fact, if the 16-year-old's on my street are any indication, the future drivers aren’t even interested in driving until mom and dad make them by telling them “We’re not going to continue being your taxi service any more”.  Then, the automobile gave us a sense of excitement, perhaps danger (benign danger, mostly, but we certainly thought we were baaaad dudes: ""Man, c'mon let's un-tuck our shirts and put masking tape over the word, 'root' on our root beer bottles"") – a sense that we were darn near outlaws, men (boys, really) without rules, barely a code, to constrain our freedoms. Woo hoo, “We're back in the saddle again”.  Today, we’re mostly left with a deteriorating highway infrastructure that really can be dangerous, but driving cars that are, if nothing else, certainly very much less deadly but mostly without any gravitational pull. The fact that a KIA (fill in the blank) or Toyota (fill in the blank) is quicker, faster, safer, almost pollution free (by comparison), comfortable as can be and will have power everything, possibly GPS and probably AM, FM, and Satellite Radio, plus CD, Bluetooth and iPhone connectivity for the iPod function doesn’t forgive the allure that even in “SE” guise these appliances lack. I mean, really, my piece-of-crap VW Beetle had more allure than many of the things that pass as cars today possess – combined.  Not many of us care either, as a glance or even a stare out of your office window to the highway below can attest. The cars go by and perhaps one in fifty is worth another second or two of your gaze. In a few short years, certainly less than a decade, the cars will be driving themselves about 75% of the time, because no one gives a damn. The cars lack allure. We’re over them. If there were unlimited mass-transit ""tubes"" that you could hop in and out of on a whim, well hell, why bother at all to go for another new Mazda or Chevy or Ford or Dodge (fill in the blank)? Nothing to see here, move along, you’ve got homes, let’s get to ‘em.  Those of us on the entry level (or Premium class) luxury performance board here know about allure – FN’s trip to Europe driving a new BMW (his BMW, not a rental), now that’s what we should all aspire to. We’re again on the precipice. Again? Yep, we’re about to lose something we’ve always had – the sense that our cars are an extension of ourselves, hand-in-glove, everything’s possible (when we're in our cars). Gone, too, is the romance of the “little ride” with our parents or with our children. The thrill (of the next time I get to drive) is gone (one hopes not forever) for many. The romance, nay, the sex-appeal of sliding in behind the wheel of your new Chevy Caprice almost has no contemporary analogy except for those who allow themselves at least a $50,000 car purchase.  Does it really take $50,000 to get allure? And, if so, how did it come to this? My father was a 6th grade math teacher, my mom a librarian, almost all cars purchased were “previously owned” (there were only 2 exceptions out of all the cars they ever bought that I can recall), yet “my” cars, my piece-of-crap cars were alluring, exciting, almost thrilling. I contend it is not necessary to spend $50,000 or more for an alluring car. I also contend that there are few car companies that realize they are killing or perhaps already have killed their future customers' interest in their products by not building alluring cars at virtually every price point.

1823,"September 20, 2015  5:58PM",breld,"Nice write-up @markcincinnati. As a stepfather to a 17 year old, I've found it interesting how the acquisition of a driver's license and a car for teenagers these days seems far less significant (or even desirable) these days. What used to signify freedom and the ability to spend time with friends at times seems more of a chore for ""kids these days,"" who can simply ""interact"" with friends from the comfort of their own rooms via a screen.  And, to be fair, from the parents' point of view, and somewhat dependent on where you live, traffic congestion and road conditions create an environment that certainly makes me uncomfortable sending our teenagers out ""cruising.""  I agree there are plenty of alluring cars at all price levels. In fact, I think some of the most engaging vehicles are in the non-luxury, compact segment. Hence, my recent ownership of a Mazda3, replacing a mid-size luxury car.  Unfortunately, it seems the luxury makes have started reserving the sportier, more engaging experience for the upper-end niche sport models. Whereas previous models of a 328i could provide a very engaging drive (and a manual for that matter), it seems you have to step up to an M3 now to get something as dynamic.  So, ALL price levels? I don't know - I think there's something missing in the middle. Compacts such as my previous Mazda3, a Civic Si, WRX, the BRZ, etc. are certainly engaging. But if you want to combine that with more refinement and some of the luxury trappings we enjoy, you have to step up to the other end of the spectrum.

But, the point is, this car seems to be ONE of the exceptions to the ""no alluring cars"" comments I made above. Also, there are a couple of VW's that seem to have some sizzle to them.  The thing is, it seems a lot of folks (of all ages) seem to think the market has very few noteworthy cars until the MSRP gets to a breathtaking number.  How is it possible for some to and most not? Perhaps we've come to a place where differentiation is either not appreciated nor demanded by the market.  The thrill (could be) is gone.  That I can go out and get an S4 or something else comparable is all well and good -- but overall the folks today, upcoming, seem to actually WANT to live in their rooms or their parent's basements..

You can imagine the Flemish not appreciating that. It is considered polite there (at least by the Flemish) that when you want to communicate in French, you ASK if they speak French. They do, but they want to be asked.  Similar thing goes in some post Soviet Union countries. They all are working very hard building their national identities, often overcompensating.

1833,"September  5, 2015  4:28PM",dino001," Here is the thing - those bailouts create resentments, especially when you consider that France used to be a superpower, cultural and science center of the world. Until WW2 French was the language of cultural elites and scientists (most articles with scientific breakthroughs were published in French journals). All of it went away in just few years, after a humiliating defeat (France didn't put much longer resistance than half sized Poland, attacked from behind by Sovients). Reminding them about it is not helpful, it's kind of like this big kid from high school with good heart but no manners pulled you out of the school yard butt kicking and then every time he sees you, or visits your house, he loudly proclaims to everybody who can hear how much he sacrificed and how grateful you should be to him. BTW, this kid is now getting all the awards, accolades, you used to get, college scouts come to see him, not you, etc. You get the picture.  To be clear, I'm not trying to diminish your father's sacrifice, or Americas role in the War, or the fact that people in Europe should be grateful for it. I'm from the part if the world that had misfortune to be ""liberated' by the Red Army and I would trade with French in a second. However, you also need to understand the wounded pride, which resulted in irrational lashing out against the very people who don't deserve it, but are close and convenient. The best way to deal with it is shrug it off and not get too flustered. It's just ignorance. Also, you need to remember that while substantial sacrifice was made, USA was also by far the greatest beneficiary of the new world order after the War and the casualties suffered are not even in the same order of magnitude and devastation than those suffered by the Europeans. Average European sees America as a net beneficiary of the War and it's not an unfair view from the global perspective (grant you not necessarily you father's).  American soldier came, fought gallantly, often died or got wounded, but then came back to his country that was intact and stronger than ever. French, Polish, or even English soldier had to stay in their ruined country, rebuild it from ground up, sometimes starving in the process, often having his family decimated.

1837,"September  5, 2015  8:53PM",markcincinnati,"I agree with the sentiments regarding civility, manners, rudeness, surliness, etc. I did take history in elementary, high-school and at Miami University. As a visitor in many European and Central European (I've not gone east of the Czech Republic or Poland) I have not ever felt I should be entitled to anything due to America's participation and help in past wars. I have Brussel-ian, Italian, Netherlandian and Luxemborgian (?) relatives. My relatives all speak at least three languages, the folks who live in The Haugue speak, Dutch, German, French, Italian and English.  The locals in Prague, universally seem to speak, in this order, Russian, German, English and Czech (some also add another language, either French, Polish or Italian). So many folks, however, seem to have a first goto language.  My point in some previous posts was the contrast between citizens of various countries -- the French were rude (at least some were); initially, I would not automatically assume they would know if we were British or Americans -- all the menus use the British flag to indicate which part of the menu is in English. I don't recall ever seeing the American flag in any country on a menu to indicate English translation here. I rarely told anyone where I was from, unless asked -- which the folks at Oktoberfest in Munich seem keen to know.  I don't think anyone I've ever known who has been to Europe goes there with anything less than a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the countrysides, the diversity of the cities (knowing that they are not 200 years old, but multiple times 200 years old). I know of no one travelling to a European destination, who has anything but a desire for a vacation -- it has never occurred to me to think too much about WWII, while visiting a European country, for instance, other than my trips to Poland (Krakow, Warsaw) where we went to the concentration camps, the salt mines. Then there was the trip to see old Warsaw which was lovingly restored after it was virtually leveled during the war. Even Prague which does have some remnants of Soviet occupation, seems much more of the now, not the then, so to speak.  I have been to Germany and Italy the most, and I have been to German museums which do put history on display -- the good, the bad and the pure evil that we all have learned about. In Amsterdam, I went to Ann Frank's house, which was also presented, er, ""objectively."" Been to Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin, too -- went to the museum, which again put some very unpleasant things on display. But the trip to the Doges Palace in Venice with the torture devices on display, is also quite eye opening.  I don't recall any resentment of the US on display anywhere -- the museums didn't editorialize or express regret, anger or, hmm, je ne sais quoi. I saw nothing that would encourage an American to somehow believe in their superiority. There were, generally speaking, no ugly Americans -- or even ignorant ones as were depicted in the Hepburn movie, set in Venice, ""Summertime.""  Continuing . . .  Took a tour of the Maginot Line, and my tour guide -- French -- made fun of France for ""how you say, a lame attempt to prevent the Germans from invading."" We did smile at his attempt at humor, but again, most of my two dozen+ trips to Europe have been as a guest in the [whatever] country, and I was pleased to be able to be a guest, in fact, I often was humbled by the locals as they were multi-lingual, whereas I was only able to speak a little German (I took lessons for about three months back in the 20th Century). I expected very little out of the local folks I would interact with, other than a certain level of courtesy since they were, after all in the hospitality business; and I did not condescend to them.  Yet, go figure, the French sometimes seemed on the verge of being annoyed by our presence with the exception of those involved with customer service at very high buck restaurants and our hotel, the PARIS - LE GRAND ($500+ per night, 5 stars). BTW, the hotel is an oh wow experience. I loved it, but I would, knowing what I now know, never stay there again (since most of the time we were there, in our room, it was night and we were in the room with no lights on, sleeping; I can find a very nice place to sleep for less than half that amount (often 3 stars), in other words; if my goal was to just stay at the hotel, I might think differently, however.)  Anyway, FN has really come through for us all -- lots of great travel and adventure, great pics and of course some car talk. I, for one, would love to hear more about the car, the driving -- any positives, any surprises, overall impressions, any ""I wish it did this"" comments, etc. It is a BMW, after all, so I would expect it to do almost everything in fine fashion, but still. Hey FN, what features and options did you configure the thing with, and which ones are you most impressed by? Is this your first vehicle with Sat Nav, if not, how is BMW's interface in your opinion?  Back to some travel tips. . .  Far as I'm concerned, Paris should be on everyone's list -- at least once. I've been there several times and despite some surly service folks, I would go again in a heartbeat, even seeing the Mona Lisa, so far, has not gotten old. Darn thing is really tiny though.

1839,"September  5, 2015  9:46PM",flightnurse,"Mark, the car is basically fully loaded, that was the nice thing about about doing a ED, Now for 2016 BMW has made major changes to the 3 series, but the GT and 4 series car's haven't gotten the ""styling"" changes like the sedan, but other ""changes"" they have. ALL 3 series and 4 series cars come with sport suspension as standard, as well as sport seats, NOW, for some odd reason, BMWNA does not think the north american x-drive cars should have the sport suspension, doesn't matter if you get the M sport package or Sport.. So the trick to is order the Dynamic handling package, and had the same time you can order the M Adaptive Suspension (think GM's magnetic ride.) So with those two options the DHP is only 1K and the M Adaptive Suspension was only $700 your x-drive will have the moves of RWD cars. So with that, we also got the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Tech package (we love the heads up display) Drivers assistance package, Auto High beams, Alarms is standard for 2016. So we have 2500KM on the car, I love the ACC, but I wish there was a way to turn the adaptive part off, here in France if the french see the slightest opening between you and the car in front they will merge right over so the adaptive part of the cruise leaves about 8 car lengths so of course the french moves right in, so what does that do, slows the car down even more, because it now has to leave more room between you and the car in front...  GPS, it's interesting, give you an example, when we left Marseilles for Beaune, we programmed the new hotel into the GPS, We first used the address of the hotel, the GPS couldn't find it, so we used google and found it that way. At times the GPS gets confused (like some women when they drive) and the directional pointer on the Nav screen will just spin around and it's not giving me a direction in which to go. This has happened a couple of time far, I'm hoping that problem will go away once the car hits north american soil..  Lighting package, the 3 series get LED lights, we have Xenon, which are adaptive. The Auto High Beams are nice, I believe I can get the Euro High beams coded in the car, in which one of the high beams will go to normal lights and the other high beam stays on.  Heated Seats, haven't tried them out yet..  Side and Top Camera's, we have a 360 degree view of the outside of the car, cool feature.  Premium Package, I love the Comfort Access, lots of cool features can be coded into the car, but you have to have Comfort access to do it.  So all F3X cars have a toggle switch to go between Eco-Pro (boring setting, it's to help save gas) Comfort, Sport and Sport+, since we have the SAT (Sport Automatic Transmission standard BTW) we gained Sport+. Sport + allows for the some of the elec nannies to turned off or not interfere so quickly. Now my 320 has the same toggle switch, before I got my car ""coded"" to activate the SAT, when I would go from Comfort to sport the only thing that really changed was the throttle setting, it was more sensitive in sport. The GT with X drive handles wonderful, when we were in Lake Como, it was raining very hard, and at times I tried to get the car side ways, had it in Sport and it would not do it.  Sport Seats, I haven't had much time to play with them, they are comfortable but could use some more adjustments..  Over all I like the car, we went back and forth on getting the 328 or the 335, part of me wish's we got the 335i, it's all all about the power..  At the Welt, I sat in the rear seat, MAN talk about room, and the seat in front of me was positioned for me...  We are averaging 24 with the car, which I don't think it so bad since we are averaging about 90 on the highways..

It was harvest time in Burgundy so the grapes were flowing, we were shown around the winery by the owner and explained the whole process.           So many of us remember Lucy crushing grapes with her feet, well, they don't do that anymore, they have machines for that.      The machine rotates and crushes the grapes and the juice flows down.    Crushed grapes     Jucie from the crushed grapes, yeah look bad, but tasted good. Once they are done crushing the grapes, they are placed in huge vats and all the sediments settle to the bottom, this is done 3 times before the juice is places into oak barrels to ferment.   Here is a map of the area where the winery is at, each color represent different types of grapes, one thing I learned was, the vast acres of grape vine we saw, are not all owned by just one company. The map show inside the vineyards small sections with lines in them, that indicated what this winery owns, as you can tell they are scarred all over the place. This is how it is done in France.     Grapes that just arrived, and was picked about an hour before the photo was taken, yes, they were very sweet tasting.    Father and Son loading the crusher for next batch.       Next we stopped by one of the most famous and most expensive wine makers in the Burgundy region Romnee Conti average bottle of wine from this winery is $300 US. and no we didn't buy anything here..        Next we went to Chateau Du Clos De Vougeot, The Clos de Vougeot vineyard was created by Cistercian monks of Cîteaux Abbey in 12th century, this is the only vineyard that is ""enclosed"" by a rock wall, and that is still intact today as it was in the 12th century. I could go on about this place, but do a search on it, it's an amazing place.          Lastly we went to a very small winery, very interesting concept, the owner build a restaurant underground that features food and wine from the area.      He also has a small collection of ""stuff""    Wine      More stuff     That was it for the tour, we were tired!! Had a great time and the A8L was awesome, I loved the message seat..

1857,"September  1, 2015  9:22PM",flightnurse,"So it's 1045pm had a great day, we are staying in Erbusco Italy, it's about 20 miles east of Bergamo, where my surname is from, going to meet cousins I have never meet before.. We are staying in a place called L'Alberete it's a hotel right in the middle of wine country, the views are breathtaking.  So to catch you up on the driving from yesterday, we left Salzburg to go to Lake Hallstatt, what a place, and the tourist love it. It's also home to one of the biggest salt mines in Austria. The Drive there was about 2 hours, nothing to really report, ate lunch hung around and left, about 2pm. Now this is where it gets weird, we I put the info into the Nav system to get us to Ljubljana, Solvenia I told it NOT to take toll road or highway. This was a big mistake. The Nav system said it was about 200 KM away, and said we would arrive about 6pm, About two hours into the drive I noticed the time to arrive keep getting longer, I went back into the nav system and saw what was chosen as the route all ""B"" roads.. I fixed this but we were so far buried into the ALPS it didn't matter, we saw some great places, then we came upon a accident. After sitting for about 30 minutes, one of the fireman came up and told us we can wait 2-3 hours before it is cleared or we can turn around and take the ""detour"", when I asked him about this detour he couldn't answer the question, mind you the Nav gave us an alternate routes but we had to go forward about 20km before they took effect (that wasn't going to work.) so we turned around and followed people who were just as lost, but they spoke German. We got a gas station and asked someone there, they gave us direction and found the detour,once we got half way through the detour we turn the Nav back on and found us a route to get moving. But this route, routed us OVER the ALPS, we hit the highest point of 1765 meters (close to 6K ft) we finally got into Slovenia, and arrived at are hotel about 815pm, about 2 hours later then we wanted.. Ljubljana is a wonderful city, we hit the town about 845 for dinner, we were supised on how many people were walking about, we were by the river that splints the city in town. Lots of history there and we both want to go back. It's a very modern city.  Salzburg has large elect bus network, but you have to see this mess all over the place.    Austria, like German have a lot of lakes, this is just one of them. Here we meet a daughter and father who were riding bikes from Munich to Lake Halstatt they are on holiday..    Hatchback and Wagons are all over the place in Germany and Austria, this has to be one of the more popular models around Europe, I would day 90% of them are diesels I saw many 118d or 120d's. BMW also makes this as a 3 door hatch, also the A3 5 door (the one we get) as well as the A1 is very popular, and most are oil burners.    First real photos of the car in bright sunlight the blue look amazing..       The 3 series has a mid-life cycle for 2016, but the GT and 4 series do not get one, however, both the GT and 4 series have received some updates that the 3 series gets. First the Rims, these have more of a grey tone to them less silver, also the middle consul and AC controls are different and lastly, the rear exhaust is black not silver this photo shows the rear exhaust.    The next two are in Lake Hallstatt, truly an amazing place.      Last is a shot of a town we detoured through, got to love iPhones and GPS, I had no idea the name of this town, but when you take a photo with the phone it says the GPS coordinates and will stamp the photo with the name later on.

1865,"September  2, 2015  6:28PM",markcincinnati,"Because they can . . .  Maybe this is old fashioned thinking.  It seems to me, if you're going to market your car with a choice of ten standard (non-custom) colors, the price should include the cost of the paint. When the customer requests a ""non-standard"" or custom color, well, whatever the traffic will allow should govern the price.  I've taken the tour through the Audi factory in Germany (6 times), and they are very proud of the part of the tour where you get to see the paint booth. There is a display near the paint facility that has the entire spectrum of available colors displayed as somewhat large paint chips (for the workers or the customers? to see). There were dozens of Audi colors apparently able to be specified -- I would call them non-custom.  I understand that Pearl Swirl Pink is probably not a color chosen often, ditto some fantastic purple swirl colors -- but, I assume the fact that they are ""on the wall"" means the factory just didn't make a one-off paint blend for a customer (perhaps Bentley does this, but I would not imagine Audi would not for $1,000, in other words.)  We're down to two (black gloss and white gloss) standard colors these days -- literally every other standard color costs extra. The Audi Exclusive line (should one venture into their paint pallet) costs even more on top of that.  It just irks me to be charged for something that shouldn't be a question. Silver is not a custom color, hell, even the purple infused black Audi calls Panther black justifies a $1,000+ optional add on. Pull the other one.  I know, I know, everyone does it and seems to get away with it -- and I do assume that some paint colors cost more to fabricate than others, but couldn't these companies just bury the cost in the base price and let the customer pick what they want. This is especially annoying since most folks don't order their cars, and therefore have no say.  Rare is the car on the lot that is gloss black -- the ones on the lot are pearl black or panther black or oolong black or whatever the name du jour is. But at anything over 10 feet away, they all look black and shiny.  Even the Ibis White (a free color) looks little, if any, different than the metallic white offered -- beyond 10 feet away.  I had no issue paying for a full-on leather interior (no alcantara, that is) for my S4, but I would have been miffed if leather was standard and yet RED leather was $1,000 upcharge. God help me if I wanted the leather in a non-standard color.  I'd gladly pay for a heated steering wheel or heated rear seats -- those options weren't available. But 'cmon, black or white paint or pay up? Luckily I am fine with white.  Now, my wife, on the other hand, just rolls with it and says, $1,075 for the color is OK.  I've watched the cars being painted, mostly it's done by robots -- does it really cost THAT much extra to get one in silver?

1873,"September  3, 2015  7:51AM",flightnurse,"So the trip from Slovenia to Erbusco Italy was a straight shot on the Autostrata, as we wanted to get to the resort we were staying at, it exceeded our expectation, it is nestled in the foothills of wine country of northern Italy, the resort is surrounded by grape vineyards, a perfect place to relax. Once we arrived, we just drove around the area to take in the sights.  Yesterday we went to Lake Como, now lake Como is shaped like an upside down Y, for me it's one of the most beautiful area's of Italy, when we left the resort it was gloomy and overcast, on the trip up we got hit with a very heavy downpour which cleaned the windshield of all bugs! We stopped in Varenna for lunch, then took the Ferry to Bellagio (yes, the hotel in Vegas is named after the city.) Then we drove home, but the rain had stopped but was still gloomy. Didn't matter the area is still beautiful.  Hotel in Varenna, just on the water.    Waiting for the Ferry to arrive, the Bently's owner saw our plates and asked where we were from, when I told him he stated he was jealous of what we North Americans can do with the ED.

1876,"September  4, 2015  5:18PM",flightnurse,"So we drove from Erbusco to Marseilles France yesterday, we decided to just do the superslab and get there fast, well 8 hour fast..  So my impressions of Italian drivers, they aren't as reckless as you hear about, they follow most of the German or Austrian driving rules, 1) they only use the Right lane to pass, 2) they use their left turn signal if they want you to move over, and 3) yes, some are crazy.  So we are motoring down the A5 autostrata and come up to slower traffic so we slow down, then barreling down on us is a VW passat wagon (they are big in Italy) and yes, it's a TDI.. The VW driving is flashing his lights, turn signal on, looks pissed that I didn't move over, Once we clear traffic and people move over (this whole time VW driver is inch's from my bumper) I nail the gas (we have 2200km on the car) and wham, talk off. VW growing smaller and smaller in the mirror. Top out at 135mph, we reach slower traffic, VW own barreling down doing the same thing, flashing lights, turn signal, giving me the Italian salute, not too sure if it was a good one or bad one. Again, once traffic opens up, and people move up, I take off, and the VW gets smaller and smaller in the mirror. Again, top out at 135, reach slower traffic, again VW driver flashing lights and turn signal, this time once we clear traffic, I get in front of slower traffic and pulled over the right land (this A5 has 3 lane's in each direction) and the VW pulled up, it's quite funny, he can tell he has it floored but not moving so fast, I nail it get in front, and pull away. Had to slow down speed limit lowered to 110 kph. VW owner catch's up and passes me.. He finally got what he wanted. It's interesting that it doesn't matter what country they are from they all barrel down on you at warp drive then get stuck on your bumper like that is going to make the car in front go faster..  France  What to say about France, if you think the Germans have an aire of attitude, you need to come from France. The attitude is, we can do that because we are french... Merging traffic, they will pull in front of you if there is day light between you and the car in front, they don't care about their cars, well most french don't.  We stopped in Monaco, did the tourist thing, stopped in front f the Casino, and got a photo of the car, TALK ABOUT CROWDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The cars, WOW, the Cars, I got one photo of a Lambo, lots of make there too. The streets are narrow REALLY narrow.. Lots of construction going on and our GPS wasn't updated on this, so it took a little longer to get to the Casino, but we got there.  Marseilles  What to say about Marseilles, I didn't know much about the city except it was a port city. It's a very old city, and it shows, when you come in from the toll road, you come in through the slums, the GPS worked great, some of the streets we went down, were REALLY narrow,dirty, and stinky. Insane is a word that Rick used a lot....  My thoughts of Marseilles, lots of immigrants, usually from north Africa, lots of different cultures, Christians, Muslims and so on. Have seen some women in Burka's walking about here and all over Europe, the native people of Marseilles aren't happy with most of the immigrants. It's a very diverse city, the food says it all, more on that later.  So here are the photos from our trip to France..  In Italy they have rest stop's but nothing like what have in the US, the rest stop has gas, food and places to eat the food outside, and they are SUPERCLEAN... The next couple of photos is one place we stopped to get gas and something to munch on.              So we stopped at a French version of the roadside gas/convenience store what a big difference, the placed looked like it was about to be shutdown, hardly no drinks in the coolers, and the bathrooms look disgusting (this was the real reason why we stopped) see for yourself. A far cry from what the ones in Italy looked like,        So car's in Europe, we have seen some American cars over here, here is a photo of one that we had a good laugh at.     Monaco is supper clean, VERY clean in fact. Monaco is not a country, it is part of France, but it is a Principality, their license plates say, Principality of Monaco on them..         So I know you are all waiting for that Lambo photo, so here it is..    Traffic lights are interesting here, if you do not stop behind the crosswalks you will not see the traffic lights, but the French being The French have a fix....     Once again the GPS, she works well, she really does but at times I have to wonder, when we left Monaco, we put into the GPS the hotel address and said, the faster route, even toll roads, well..... For about 60 km we were on two lane country roads, then finally back on the toll roads.. She tries..

1883,"September  4, 2015  9:49PM",markcincinnati,"You commented about German, er, personalities then followed up with your observations about French personalities. Granted, my European travels have been entirely recreational, but I would say that only in 2 countries have I ever noted an attitude that was less than gracious. France (several times) and Switzerland once in Lucerne (come to think of it the person in Lucerne had a heavy French accent.)  The German people have always been friendly, polite, courteous and sometimes playful even. I've been to Oktoberfest about 6 times, and when going into a beer tent, you join a large group of people at a picnic table and within a few minutes it seems the folks are wanting to know about the US, US sports and are trying to teach us Americans some of the German-only songs that come up every 15 minutes or so between good ol' Rock and Roll. A gentleman and his father were in Munich for Oktoberfest and when they found out my wife was a lawyer, the older man bought my wife an order of peeled radishes (covered in salt) from one barrister to another. We had a great time. The folks on the subways in Munich, too, are always willing to help you figure out which stop will get you closest to your destination.  In France, on the other hand, we went to a bistro, like you see in the movies, in Paris and the waiter gave up his picture for the dictionary next to the word ""surly"". Apparently since tipping is not as serious as it is in the US, this waiter was actually pissed when we thanked him (in English) when he brought us our wine, beer and cheese saying (in heavily accented French) ""why can't you people even TRY to speak French?"" OK, well perhaps I could say merci, but other than asking ""how's the weather"" and saying ""I like chocolate ice cream"" I didn't think I wanted to embarrass myself or run the risk of butchering my communications (especially since the menu we were given was multi-lingual). How wude!  The staff at our (5-star) hotel in Paris was totally gracious and friendly, but my impression, from several interactions with the locals, was that they don't like us much -- or maybe they just don't like me. I went ahead and gave an American tip anyway, who knows if anything changed. The Italians were huggers and both-cheek kissers (didn't have that happen in Germany, but they were friendlier than the French.)  FN, I have no clue as to your age -- I am 63 -- I started going to Europe when I was about 20 years younger (and richer), but it can be done for not too much money, if you realize that most of the time you spend in a Hotel it is dark (meaning, 3-star hotels with air conditioning work just fine). Once I got over the sense that we needed 5 star hotels (because, well, you never know), we found we could see Europe for not much money (saving our coin for fine dining instead). Also, we don't use cabs anymore, we figure out how to use the trains and subways -- and for the long trips, we splurge on first class train travel if the distance is over 5 hours. Also became a fan of night trains with full size beds (saves on hotel bills too). My point is, unless you're much much older, I urge you to make this trip one of many, many more you should take. Benelux was a fun couple of trips -- Amsterdam, Brussles and Luxembourg city, do it again, do it again.  Anyway, you've taken me, at least, on a great vicarious trip with you two.

1894,"August 30, 2015  9:42PM",markcincinnati,"In the mid-1980's, I owned an Audi (what else?) 5000CS turbo quattro, then Audi's top-of-the-line car. Manual transmission, power everything and a new to the market feature (and quite a rare feature on almost any car outside of an Audi, BMW or Mercedes) anti-lock brakes. For some reason I ordered the car with the optional wool covered sports seats, eschewing the standard leather treatments. But that’s not important to my warning and plea to anyone reading this.  This mid-80’s Audi had a permanently mounted voice controlled and activated cellular telephone. While driving, if I uttered the phrase “Turn on telephone” I could “Call home,” “Call office,” or recite a phone number – one number at a time, wait for the phone to repeat the number, and so on until the full number had been spoken, then dial. Hands free, eyes free. It was 1985.  My first Audi S6, a 1996 model was the next Audi I purchased that came with a factory phone (it was hidden in the arm-rest) permitting voice command. This version was updated and allowed me to recite the phone number in single digits without waiting for the phone to parrot my number back to me.  When I then purchased a new 1997 A8, I was somewhat amazed that it came pre-wired for a phone, but without a phone. Of course I ponied up for another voice activated phone. When I got my 2003 allroad it came with a special in-armrest holder for an Audi-branded phone and it also came with On*Star which was also a phone (voice activated) and an email client (that read my emails to me and also allowed me to send emails by speaking). My 2005 A6 was bluetooth equipped and came with a list of phones I could buy from several different providers and also had a special, in-armrest holder/charger that was invisible with the arm-rest cover closed.  My 2009 A4, 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD and my 2014 S4 also are equipped with bluetooth and they also have pig-tails for charging and [iPhone] music connectivity. Every one of these cars I mention, since 1985, has had hand and eyes free phone capability and ever improving voice command capabilities.  I finally have gotten around to keeping my iPhone in my breast pocket, but for years my iPhone often was in the trunk where I put my brief case. The phone works fine when it is in the trunk – and now, since I do use the phone for email and texting (after pulling over), I tend to keep the phone in the cabin.  Every few seconds or minutes someone has a crash or is killed and the “incident” (they are not accidents) causing the property damage or living being damage is attributed to texting or other mobile device distracted driving.  The technology exists to disallow talking and texting in a moving vehicle. I assume no challenge would exist to make the phone work if it is being used via bluetooth hand and eyes free initiation. The clock is ticking backwards, to zero, to a time when we will have no ability to use these communication’s devices in a moving car.  Here’s what confuses me: Since there had been some kind of hand and eyes free, voice-activated communications available since the mid-1980’s, how is it possible that I cannot drive more than one mile out of my rural subdivision without seeing someone driving their ELLPS (and I’ll keep it to ELLPS cars, even though such technology is hardly limited to the Premium class and above) with their phone held up to their ear (requiring one hand)? As I get closer to the Interstate and traffic density increases, I could probably throw a handful of rice into oncoming traffic and hit more cars than not whose drivers are holding their phones – and I am certain many of the rice grains would hit bluetooth equipped vehicles.  Before you respond, here’s another data point, most of the cars have one person in them – the driver.  I get my car serviced, I am provided with a loaner – before I pull out of the dealership, I pair my phone with the loaner’s Bluetooth – if I’m distracted, this takes 30 seconds. My wife actually has the service manager pair her phone with the loaner, figuring it’s part of the Audi Advantage (and the service writer always takes the 30 seconds to do this for her without issue).  I thought, way back there 30 years ago, “I can completely be focussed on driving this stick-shift turbo-charged ‘hot rod’ quattro thanks to my hands and eyes free cellular phone.” Is this technology not “way cool”? And, is this technology not a HUGE safety feature, right up there with seat belts, crumple zones, ESP and ABS, sealed beam headlights, disc brakes and so on?  I do want to be able to call home or the office without touching the phone, without looking at the phone and without pulling over and parking due to the inevitable governmental safety nanny. I want to delay yet another restriction brought on by my fellow drivers who opt for the most dangerous and deadly way I can think of to make a phone call.  Of course, maybe we’ll be allowed to used a phone in the car once cars start driving themselves. Mean time, I’d just like to advocate for voluntary cessation of in-car phone usage if it is not hand and eyes free.

1901,"August 31, 2015  1:50PM",markcincinnati,"???  Driver of a late model Lexus merges onto I-75 south, immediately moves to the left-most lane, slows to 50 (apparently setting cruise control) and using one free hand, starts holding the phone to his ear -- the conversation apparently goes on for many miles, although I broke protocol after a few miles and committed one of the most vile acts anyone can do behind the wheel . . . I passed on the right after my repeated attempts at turning on my left turn signal were ignored.  I'm all for most freedoms -- really. But, you can't yell fire in a theater (unless there really is one) and expect to be covered by the first amendment. I guess, technically, there is no reason you can't hop onto a major federal highway and drive in the left-most lane at 50 MPH (the speed limit here in Ohio has, in many places, now been bumped to 70); I also assume passing on the right side (or suicide) isn't illegal. But, and it pains me to say this, I would vote for laws that would disallow both of these behaviors, were such items placed on a ballot. But, then again, I am also in the minority that votes.  We're doomed.  Just another reason I can't imagine the frustration of owning/driving an RS7 or M5 or CTS-V, etc, where in wide wide world of sports can such machines be driven using more than a fraction of their engineer-imbued ""talents?"" Not that a Prius is all of a sudden looking good.  One more note - I would imagine that driving in Italy would be a free-for-all (and Rome, actually, is). But, other than perhaps a slight decrease in speed, the folks driving on the Italian Autobahn (the autostrada, as I recall), behave pretty much exactly like the Germans -- lane discipline, left lane to pass and the lanes get faster the further left you go, period. Folks respond to a wink of your turn signal to get over and, from what I can tell (other than in Rome) there is no road-rage.  Although many of our Interstate road surfaces are pock-marked, I generally think we have a well thought out (mostly) highway system here, that is rendered far less efficient that it could be by either ignorance, stupidity or lack of driver training. Instead, here, we rely, in this order, upon: Enforcement (sort of), Engineering (a somewhat distant second) and Education (a very distant third.) I would think we could drive faster, experience fewer delays, fewer hours lost per person, per year, etc, if we just made getting a driver's license require a bit more rigor. One would think, considering the death-rate, that getting a DL should require no less preparation and education than getting a pilot's license. My wife got her pilot's license before she was old enough to get a driver's license -- and she thinks that getting a DL is about like getting a box-top off of a box of Wheaties.  Something is wrong with that.  One last note: I love test driving all kinds of cars, despite my completely above-board bias toward Audis, German cars and European cars, generally. I have taken so many folks on test drives these past 5-10 years, I can't remember just how many. Not one (other than my wife) has ever had ABS engaged (that they know of -- although I wonder if they just don't know what ABS braking feels like); and the thing is, when I -- in a large deserted parking lot -- get them to engage ABS, the moment the pedal pulsing starts, they [so they say] instinctively know to release the brake to the point the pulsing stops.  I have been through 4-two day Audi Driving Experiences (on ice), 1-two day BMW Driving Experience (not on ice) one Porsche Driving Experience (1-day) and a Cadillac driving experience (also 1-day). Every instructor literally starts the training with the following exercise: accelerate to about 50MPH from a dead stop and when you reach the orange cone laying on its side at the end of the ""runway"" press the brake pedal ""as if"" this is a panic stop. To a man/woman instructor, the command is ""when the pulsing is felt through the pedal, press the brake as hard as your leg can press -- imagine your goal is to BEND THE BRAKE PEDAL.""  The reason given for this ""press harder"" instruction is always, ""braking force will continue to increase the harder you press, even with Brake Assist (which bases braking force somewhat on the speed at which the driver presses down)."" I've seen this impact myself on dry, wet and icy pavement.  Yet, when I try to get someone who is testing a new car to brake with any degree of urgency, the instant the pulsing is felt, they release the brake -- which, were this a real emergency could increase the probability of a crash.  We need to license drivers much, much more rigorously. And, despite this old fashion notion, I think knowing how to drive a manual transmission would be helpful too, much in the same way it is said that video games are helpful prerequisites for so many endeavors.  I happen to love my DSG transmission, but in a heartbeat, going back to a six-speed manual wouldn't be anything but fun.

1906,"August 31, 2015  4:57PM",markcincinnati," A friend of mine is married to an Ohio State trooper -- he claims that passing on the right is many times more of a contributing factor to crashes than speeding. Bet the speed laws, however, are quite rigorously enforced.  Why is that? Are the fines from speeding higher than from passing on the right infractions? Wait, wait, don't answer that, yet: If the speeding fines are, for example, $100, then passing on the right fines ought to be $250 -- you would think once the word got out that such infractions would sharply shrink.  I'm one of the people that thinks you should either take laws off the books that are routinely ignored or that the infraction fines should be made proportionate to the potential bodily and property damage that such infraction, if ignored, suggests. And, then, of course, enforce them.  So, if my friend's trooper husband is correct, that passing on the right side really is suicide and that speeding, in an of itself is less likely to cause death and destruction, why not ""align the time (i.e., the fine) with the crime"" so to speak? Full disclosure, I have little compunction about driving 85 or 90 in a 70 zone (with assured clear distance), but, as noted, I break out in hives and nausea if I am dragged kicking and screaming into passing on the right due to some moron who certainly must be ignoring my repeated wink, wink, winking left turn signal ""the universal (and polite) signal to please let me pass.""  OK, I have one more ? to pose -- I took driver's ed in high school, I took a course to learn to teach driver's ed in college -- why is it we are taught to maintain about 15' per 10MPH assured clear distance between you and the car in front of you (on the highway, not on the crowded stop and go streets of, say, Manhattan) yet, if you were even to attempt to keep 90' between you and the car in front of you on the state highway or Interstate highway at 60MPH, you are assured someone will risk heaven and earth, life and limb to squeeze in between you and the car in front of you and then essentially brake hard, thereby causing a ripple effect of some dozens and dozens of miles on such thoroughfares as the long flat and straight stretch of highway say between Cincinnati and Columbus OH?

1925,"August 27, 2015  8:08PM",markcincinnati,"I've Got Friends in ""High"" Places  OK, time for the 45,000 mile service on the '14 SQ5. Dropping the car off the night before, picking up a courtesy car for the day and coming back 24 hours later . . . routine.  ""I'm sorry, I don't have any SQ5 loaners . . . but I've got this freshly PDR'd car that has 35 miles on it you can have, if you don't mind. It's an A8L. I also have a new A7, but I thought you might like to be the very first customer to drive the A8.""  Actually, I had hoped for an A6 -- considering some of our recent ""chats"" here on edmunds. But, it is so very unlikely we'd ever willingly, knowingly and with our own money go for another A8 (not that we didn't like our previous one), well, why not.  I am a lover and geek on all things Audi, but frankly I just don't spend any time keeping up with the A8 or R8 cars, I needed an edumacation . . . .  This was the L version -- the back seat space is larger than some closets or storage sheds, if the thing wasn't so quiet at speed, you'd need an intercom to speak to the pilot were you seated back there,  Otherwise, we set the drive select to dynamic (the rep looked at my wife who set this parameter after starting the car, and said ""go figure"" -- my wife is used to an SQ5, after all) and turned on the heads-up display, found some nice tuneage on the sat radio and drove off in eerie silence arriving a triple digits speeds in the blink of an eye. Yikes this thing must be electric it is so quiet and smoooth (and this one had the air suspension, which I suspect is standard and the 20"" wheels with summer only rubber.)  Full LED front and rear lighting -- and everything that could be motorized was -- and oh that fantastic, should be mandated by the Feds, Top View monitor (how I miss that one aspect of our 2011 Infiniti).  I finally got the sticker out of the glove box and noted this puppy was a V6 (333HP) -- my S4's V6. Impressive in this size car as it never seemed to want for any bit of power -- there was always plenty on reserve.  Air conditioned seats -- ahhhhh cooling those hot crossed buns -- I had forgotten how nice cool leather can feel, even on a hot summer day.  Here's the real deal, however -- while the car is, even were it free -- too large, it feels not much larger than my S4. Also, I cannot tell a lie, it is not as nimble as an S4, and certainly not as powerful as you would expect with the extra girth the motor had to manage, but it seemed quite capable of convincing perhaps the vast majority of folks that it was a sporting-like sedan, not just a luxo-barge. The top view camera made navigating a tight parking garage this morning easy-peazy.  If you have $92,000 (but this one had a nearly $6,000 Executive package credit, wiping out the Executive package price) laying around burning a hole wanting to be spent on a new luxury but still very much a driver's car vehicle, say no more, look no further. I can't imagine my neighbor's 7 series (also an L) which, by comparison, seems so stark and strident inside -- and which cost over $110K could be more attractive, price weighted.  I don't know how the 2016 A8L 3.0T is thought of by the pros, but this amateur thinks for $86,000 nothing even comes close -- in this class (large luxo-barge).  Of course, had I that much coin to drop on ONE car, I would still ""settle"" on a full-on great balls of fire S6 Prestige with the custom red leather seats.  Now that would be something to write home about.  Me, I'm looking forward to a slightly larger 2018 S4 with all the cool tech this 2016 A8 has on it.

1927,"August 28, 2015  1:40AM",markcincinnati," I did look at a Panamera -- and with anything even close to the content of the A8, the price would shoot over $100K.  The Audi that I would think much more competitive (in every aspect) with the Panamera is the RS7. This A8L was an ocean-going vessel -- the fact that it felt smaller than its barge like dimensions doesn't make it anything that would be attractive to someone who would look at either an RS7 or Panamera, if you axe me.  While I liked the temporary experience, I wouldn't even consider one, personally. I wonder if the S8 might be more of a Panamera cross-shopper. Don't know . . . and not all that interested in making a comparison, at this point, life's too short. A half step between an A4 and A6 is about the size I find interesting today.  About $58K for my S4 and about $65K for my wife's SQ5 -- what's that come to?"" $123K -- for TWO cars. Something just seems ""off"" about spending that much on ONE car -- but I could be wrong. There comes a point where I read about the $85K Cadillac V or M3 and their accelerations to 62MPH are in the neighborhood of 4 seconds. I then go back in time and find the same magazine's numbers for my ""lowly"" S4 to be 4.8 seconds (some magazines claim even quicker). I'll keep the $27K for other things and make certain never to challenge an M3 to a drag race at the local traffic light. I'm all for big bad acceleration, etc, but all that money for such a relatively small increase in acceleration is something that I find very difficult to justify, especially since it is so rare I can ever floor my non-tumescent S4 for fear of overtaking and rear ending just about everything else on the road.",never temporary point rare content think big bad dont im 65k 100k overtaking challenge consider either short interested competitive could road 62performance keep quicker wrong every ending dimensions half increase else justify money interesting 4 back making know relatively much axe doesnt 58k shoot crossshopper small spending light barge audi ever close local especially performance someone even step 27k personally bmw vessel liked anything cadillac everything traffic might look two numercedesers aspect make come comparison seconds race difficult today wonder since read time panamera lowly saudi would aaudiractive price seems 123k whcadillac things performances certain wouldnt felt cars drag fact audil etc find 85k mercedesim ill rear lifes something go experience one smaller like 48 fear nontumescent oceangoing wifes car neighborhood magazines size comes floor v

Of all of the European cities we've been to, Munich is the one where I think I could live AND work. Much as we like Verona and Prague, and even Kraków (and what's not to like about London, Paris and even Brussles), Munich is THE city where I think I could work. The train from Munich to Venice, via Innsbruck is the most beautiful ride we've ever taken -- and OMG in winter, as my friend says, ""If there is winter in heaven, this is what it MUST look like.""

The last time I looked into this, it seemed that the price delta paid for the trip -- and then, if you factor in the cost of renting a car, you actually end up paying only for your hotels and food, making the trip to some of the most beautiful sights on the planet about equal to or less than a trip to the US west coast (from Cincinnati).

1945,"August 29, 2015  5:42PM",dino001,"Yeah, the ED MSRP is 7 percent off base model US MSRP plus destination and options are priced at US MSRP. It makes base models especially great deals, then as you add options, the discount gets smaller. So for example 50k base plus 5k options plus 900 destination it is 52.4k, or 3.5 grand nominal savings. However, you don't get any additional rebates, like those cash credits or rebates that BMW sometimes throws for the US delivery (disclaimers often specifically exclude ED). You can negotiate the price down from the ED MSRP toward their invoice just the same as US delivery (unlike Benz or Volvo, which have the ED prices price fixed), but many dealers would have none of it. Don't know why, perhaps it's just posturing, but I heard of that several times. I think it may be their way of discouraging of doing it, as they always prefer intant gratification of delivery, so the attitude may be, fine, but I'm not doing a damn thing to incentivise the deal vs. my stock. There are also complications with the trade, if you want to make one, as there is about three month from signing the deal and getting the car. Essentially, you lose any leverage on the trade price, unless you are willing to give the car at time of the signing the deal.  Bottom line, the actual savings depend on the context of its actual going transaction prices for stock Deliveries. For models selling close to MSRP, like say M-models, the savings are great. For those selling closer to invoice, or having extra cash rebates, it is less. However, factoring the extra vacation experience, even if the savings aren't as big as the face value, it's totally worth it. BTW, you can combine ED with so-called Performance Delivery in South Carolina, which makes the experience even more awesome. Paid night at Sheraton, dinner, breakfast, morning at a track, doing quick loops, braking, skip pad (not your car, just one that's a same or similar similar model; they put me in 335), then a factory visit, plus X5 off-road course after lunch.

I would think if you get enough cars out there AND they are indeed a good and reliable (they can work on durable later) product, well economics 101 -- demand will go up as price drops (IF the reliability is there).  Include all maintenance, of course and improve the dealership experience to Premium Car (European and Japanese) expectations.  Then, assuming all of the above (especially the goodness of the product) comes to pass, THEN allow the sub-venting to erode. As the post above says -- this will be about a 10 year exercise.  I must say, after watching Audi and UNINTENDED acceleration etc, 10 years would be a bargain, if Cadillac could pull it off in that period of time.  At some point in time, however, the product/brand differentiation has to shift from low price to a specific brand identity based on ""something you're known for"" or perhaps several somethings that you're known for.  I know of no one that is a animated and passionate about any Cadillac in the same way many Audi and BMW ""fans"" have passion.

1963,"August 25, 2015  1:14PM",dino001,"I think the ""old GM"" is in the comeback exactly because that bankruptcy was tainted by politics. Law blatantly disregarded - for those who don't know, stakeholder's payoff order was changed in favor White House political backers (i.e. unions) rather than those who (by law) deserve it most (senior bondholders with secured notes). This basically taught them wrong lesson.  In essence, the process was not painful enough. Bankruptcy is supposed to be painful, as it wipes out those with weak interest (like shareholders, employees) and damages those with stronger interest (debt holders, government). It's an exchange - bondholders stop the imminent execution of the debt and in exchange they receive equity in reorganized company. All of that is overseen by a judge in a process that usually starts as adversarial and ends as cooperative. The plan for the reorganized company needs to be approved by a judge, but the bondholders have ample opportunity to give their input and voice their concerns. NONE OF THAT HAPPENED!!! Government came, wiped out those they deemed ""unworthy"" (and used media to vilify them in the process), gave rewards to those who were ""worthy"" (read supported their political cause) and then bullied judicial system to approve the tainted deal. A true disappointment was that the judges did not find enough courage to stop it. I can only guess why.  In this climate, how anybody can make real decisions? Those that can be even more difficult and more painful? There is no way.

1965,"August 25, 2015  3:27PM",markcincinnati,"dino001:  Let's stipulate that your observations are accurate. We then need to say that we can't un-ring the bell.  As a practical matter, while your comments would still be accurate they would probably not be made or even too much cared about if what emerged was a ""great"" car from a great car company (isolating Cadillac here).  I went to a friend's birthday party over the weekend -- of course after the dinner, some of the typical male/female behavior emerged with the two genders gathered in two groups catching up and being social. One of the well-wishers apparently was well off enough to have had several Ferrari's and he was remarking how he had never had any car have a $10,000 bill for what he would classify as routine mntce (a new clutch for a manual transmission Ferrari). His beloved Italian had just cost him this much -- ouch!  The conversation about cars was ""on."" In the parking-lot population of a couple of dozen premium cars (from Europe and Asia) there was a lone Cadillac CTS coupe. We all agreed the car was handsome -- the owner added his own comments suggesting that he agreed the car was beautiful to behold but that it had been a lot of trouble and that his [few] Cadillac owning friends had not one satisfied member amongst them.  I'm not sure what all of the ""big"" problems were, but problems seemed to plague just about every system a car has, according to him. The birthday boy (age 60) has a Mercedes V8 coupe (the $125,000 version whatever/whenever that is) and a Sonota with 120K miles on it. He wants a Porsche -- don't know what one -- but he says he can't beat the Sonota for its 100% reliability (and, at 120K miles, I would expect he would add durability, too), so he drives it to the office and saves the Merc for weekends. He also has one of those giant Yukon XL SUV's and a couple of Harley's.  Were I a Cadillac employee or affiliated in any way with Cadillac, this would have been a cringe-worthy event, with folks saying mostly positive things about everything but Cadillac's cars; and the things being said about Cadillac were enough to make someone in the market, draw a line through the brand altogether -- with the possible exception of the Escalade.  One couple drove their new Mercedes GLA crossover -- which I was able to see up close and personal, interior included. Very nice looking car -- especially from the outside. Interior fit and finish seemed nice, but man the thing was really small inside -- smaller, I think, than an Audi Q3. I don't know how much actual utility it had, how many groceries it could carry, but I do think it is one of Mercedes best looking products in years.  My take away from the whole evening -- pertaining to cars -- was that Cadillac is not in a particularly good place right now with respect to what ""the people"" (the market) are saying. Here [Edmund's] we've got folks saying ""are you kidding"" with respect to the price vs the competition and you have the bourgeoisie saying the cars are, well, pretty much crap with respect to reliability.

I mentioned as part of one of my rants/posts that when I grew up in rural Ohio in the 60's, there were Chevy ""guys"" and Ford ""guys"" and even some Chryco (aka mopar) ""guys.""  The passion of the Chevy folks was the relentless kidding of the Fix Or Repair Daily crowd and of course the other way around (General Mess of Crap, as I recall). The Buick car company had seriously powerful cars -- my buddy drove a Buick Special to high school every day (and this was a full-sized V8 packin' hot rod -- don't let's it mass confuse you, you face off with the Special, you see tail lights.) Of course there were Goats and Stangs and my favorite (Beep Beep) Plymouth road runners that, in a straight line, were scary good and ready to smoke the rear tires, or actually SHRED the rear tires.  My cousin had an Impala SS (a two-door affair with a HUGE butt but also gobs of tire smokin' power) with a rear deck speaker WITH REVERB! Whew, I'm all verklempt.  The faithful high schoolers became faithful, loyal customers of their chosen brands -- my parents first had Hudson Hornets, then, with the demise of Twin H power (dual carbs), dad moved to Plymouth, then Chrysler -- I recall when I was in college he got a Cordoba, with fine Corinthian leather and the fake leather half roof.  The point is, my uncles were loyal to their brands -- my Augusta, GA uncle always had Pontiacs, his two brothers, one of them my dad had Chryco cars -- my uncle had a Plymouth Sport Fury, Plymouth's answer to the Chevy Impala Super Sport.  I mean these folks, then, wouldn't be budged from the brand.  What the heck happened?  Now, before I go into the weeds too deeply, I must say my friends are mostly loyal to a brand. My BMW driving friends will probably never stray. My buddy who drives Acuras, just won't even bother shopping elsewhere.  So what happened -- one would think there would have been at least some vestige of brand loyalty and that ought to translate to Cadillac as well. Apparently not.  What I have found is ""American"" car dealers didn't get the memo that must've come out at the end of the 70's or the early 80's. I simply, personally, can't imagine putting up with the crap these hold over dealers ""Fast Eddy's"" or ""Juicy Lucy's"" and their ilk deal.  Is it a matter of the dealerships? Is it a matter of . . . what? You'd think if you were a dealer facing a declining market, that you would ""go undercover"" and see how the most successful dealerships treat their ""clients"" and flat out imitate that behavior.  Sure, you may have to kiss a lot of frogs, but eventually you're going to learn what the attraction is -- at least at the Premium and Lux brands -- a Cadillac dealer with even one Fast Eddy or Juicy Lucy on the payroll isn't going to cut it.  Of course, this doesn't wipe out all of the sins of an iffy product, but maybe it would help.

Prototypes are now being made, but the NSX won't be for sale for about 6 months as a 2017 model. Auto Blog as some tidbits they've gotten from the engineers and builders of the NSX, which is being built in Ohio:  http://www.autoblog.com/2015/08/15/acura-nsx-cosworth-engine-block-details/  ""Acura NSX will use Cosworth block, plus other neat tidbits   The blue NSX you see here was built just two weeks ago. Prototype number six, it rolled off Acura's newest assembly line in Ohio and was rushed out to the Monterey peninsula for various car week activities. We had a chance to sit down with several members of the NSX team to discuss the car, the long road from concept to production, and some interesting details. Below are some choice bits from our conversations.  Acura is pretty proud of the fact that NSX version 2.0 was designed and is being built in the US. The new assembly line, called the Performance Manufacturing Center, is in Honda's hometown of Marysville, Ohio. While the line is brand new, the building has seen many uses over its lifetime, most recently as a warehouse facility. PMC staff numbers about 100, with 60 technical and 40 non-technical associates.  The car uses parts sourced globally, and one of those sources is Cosworth. The engine blocks and heads come from the English firm and get assembled into twin-turbo powerhouses at Honda's nearby Anna, Ohio, engine plant. The Cosworth name is rarely associated with a bad engine, so we were geeked to hear the NSX's 550-plus-horsepower hybrid powertrain has good genes....  ....the NSX buyer will get to make lots of decisions to craft a custom order. Choices will include paint, interior hues, several wheel styles and finishes, and additional carbon-fiber parts and trim; the standard car will have an aluminum roof, while a carbon piece can be spec'd, and available carbon dress-up pieces will include side sills, a rear diffuser, and an engine dress-up kit. The newly announced blue paint, called Nouvelle Blue Pearl, like the red used on the 2015 show car, uses a fancy multi-layer paint process from PPG that does a nice job of highlighting the surfacing and creases in the car's body. It gave the production engineers a headache, however, since it takes about 16 hours to cure versus regular paint's two-hour wait time. Not surprisingly, it will be an extra-cost option.""

I read their words, I do not have any experience that would allow me to make an informed (and possibly biased or unbiased) comment on the matter.  I would, initially, expect a $60K car to be in some ways superior to a $30 or $40K car, content, styling, performance, the whole package-wise. This would not be an indictment against the lesser cost vehicle.  For the moeny, were I to be given a Subaru budget, I would NOT opt for the 5-year old Audi -- I would indeed go with something NEW (very possibly the Subaru).  My experiene would lead me to advise someone who wanted S4-like performance for less money, to look seriously at an Acura TLX SH-AWD (Advance). If the Premium Car experience was unimportant to this someone, I would certainly suggest they shop Subaru, especially if one of their criteria was having AWD.  I have, very recently, read some reviews of the Nissan Maxima Platinum version -- while not a member of the Premium Class (as defined by someone, somewhere), this new Maxima certainly seems to ring many of the bells that one would normally associate with ELLPS -- although Infiniti folks would certainly beg to differ.  Most of what I seem to come across in my google searches are essays and sites that praise Audi's TorSen based quattro system as ""one of the best"" or sometimes even the best AWD systems currently on the market.  That Subaru's system may be right up there is something I shall surely remember when I come across such commentary or test reports. Mean time, since we're not speaking/discussing, HERE of either Lambo's or Subbie's systems, I suggest we discuss an even larger issue for some folks: AWD vs 2WD -- my position is that AWD is what the market is looking for and willing to spend money on.

2001,"August 21, 2015  7:21PM",markcincinnati,"Tire Update  I have a couple thousand miles on my Continental DWS 06 UHP A/S tires.  While very good from mile one and better after mile 150, now at a couple grand miles on the road, I can offer this:  These tires are really UHP tires, they do not, from my perspective here in SW Ohio, need to apologize or explain why they are a compromise shoe. I can think of no attribute of this tire that makes me long for a MAX Perf (summer only) tire instead. I do not track my car. I do not take my car off normal highways, roads and streets. I generally enjoy taking corners and curves as aggressively as possible (given traffic and other safety considerations, of course). When conditions and traffic (and the long arm of the law) permits, I have been known to exceed 100MPH (usually on Interstates where traffic is thin and widely spaced).  I like a tire to be quiet. I do not want ANY tread noise. Not gonna tolerate it.  The handling, braking, ""quietness"", comfort and anything you can think of that describes performance of these tires is (are) exemplary. While not cheap, the tires will not require you to take out a second mortgage, and they should last some 40,000+ miles and still remind you they are (mostly) still UHP tires.  Unless you have no need for cold weather or ""light-snow"" traction, these tires should be given a good look-see and test drive (if possible). I don't want to make this too dramatic, but I cannot think of any tire that I have ever had that exceeds the performance of the DWS 06 Continental Extremes.

2011,"August 14, 2015  3:58PM",markcincinnati,"You Never Close Your Eyes . . .  To many – perhaps most – of us born in the ‘50’s, it is difficult to comprehend or even imagine the apparent blasé attitude of many Americans, most of them born after the ‘70’s or ‘80’s (apparently), toward cars. I work with 30, 40 & 50-somethings. Only those seeing, or soon seeing their 5th decade seem to have much, if any, interest in cars. One gentleman loves his Mini; and is a pretty ardent participant in local and even some national Mini events.  Getting him started on what he did last weekend surely invites him to share the pictures from the most recent cross-country Mini event or gathering. He has a map over his desk outlining a coast-to-coast Mini drive, and it is easy to find him gazing – longingly – at that map from time-to-time. Other than that, these “youngsters” seem to care less about what “my peeps” hold dear: Fine cars, fine dining, fine wine and home theaters that require a minimum of a 70” screen.  These “yutes” seem mildly, or politely, interested in “my generation’s” escapades, but there is virtually no-one left on the planet who seems to know or care much about cars – far as I know, I’m the only subscriber to any auto-enthusiast magazines; no really, I’m the last one, anywhere.  One of the mid-fifty-ish folks I know recently traded in his stick-shift Acura TL for a used RDX (really incredibly low mileage). He had, at least, taken the time to research his purchase, remarking about the SH-AWD and the turbo charged engine (and he loves the DVD-Audio sound system). But, beyond his own vehicle, beyond the Acura brand, he neither knows nor cares.  My nephew, a twenty-something wrapping up his undergraduate degree (part time) while working (full time), certainly has the means to drive something that could get his adrenaline pumping, but he has a Saturn – and I don’t think it has been washed anytime in the 21st century, leading me to conclude he cares not at all for cars (his at least).  OK, so I can find almost no-one interested in discussing the “Performance Sedan” (ELLPS and/or LPS) class. Must be that when I was growing up the automobile was the symbol of freedom, fun and somewhat even a symbol of a certain status (thinking of V8 vs 6, “SS” vs Biscayne, etc.). Thin red-striped sidewall tires, “Wide-Oval” rubber and Hurst Shifters in your newly acquired Goat ruled my formative years. I couldn’t wait to get my temps, my license and ultimately my own car, a 1963 lime-green Chrysler Newport. I ran the thing without an air-cleaner and pulled the hub-caps (remember those?) and shined the matte black paint on the wheels with STP and Pledge (as I recall, I did this ritual daily – at least during the good months of the year).  Today, our office manager a late-30’s woman, cares about cars perhaps on-par with dishwashing machines and dual-fuel ranges; no wait, dual-fuel ranges rule, especially if they come from Kitchen Aid or Jenn-Air.  Today’s youth, consisting, in part, of tomorrow’s Premium Class buyers look at cars almost as a necessary evil or, at best, a four-wheel appliance – seemingly the more sterile and passionless the better.  It seems to me that cars must no longer symbolize freedom, rather they suggest you're “joining a group” [under duress] – these post-baby boomers somehow “lost that lovin’ feelin’” so many of us embraced then and, without being too sentimental, come close to cherishing today.  I recall my sophomore year at college – I had met the girl. She lived in Florida, I in Ohio, and I just couldn’t imagine how we could spend Thanksgiving break apart, so I filled up the ol’ ’63 Newport and made the drive – virtually non-stop – from Oxford, Ohio to Naples, Florida. It is a wonder I didn’t kill myself, I got so sleepy.  The point is, the car granted me both the ability and freedom to choose to make the moronic decision to drive, almost literally, down and back over a three-day period (and, since I needed gas money, I had to sleep in the damn car, unable to afford a place to stay). I loved it.  “Kids” today don’t take “road trips,” don’t yell “shot-gun” and don’t know that a ’63 Newport had the 361 CI V8, while the 300 and the New Yorker had a 383 and a 413 respectively. Clarification, I would not expect a 20-year old today to know much, if anything about a 1963 vintage automobile; my point is these youngin’s don’t know what 335i, 328i, quattro, SH-AWD, 4-Motion, Tip-tronic or even ABS means. I assume they know the name BMW, Cadillac and Ferrari, however – I hope they do, anyway.  Automobile manufacturers have a lot of research, development and marketing to do if they want to return to their former selves, in terms of being Objets de Desír.

2018,"August 14, 2015  7:07PM",markcincinnati,"breld: My S4 is a mechanical device and, like all such devices, isn't perfect. Having said that, I am now north of 32,000 miles and, other than springing perhaps a little early for new tires, have nothing negative to report with respect to reliability, drive-ability, performance or efficiency.  I ordered mine with A/S tires, which does set the top speed limit (which can be changed with a keystroke or two) to 130MPH. Mine is a Premium+ model (DSG 7-speed transmission) with MMI/Navigation Plus, Audi-side assist, full leather [no alcantara inserts] seats (in red), B&O sound system/speakers, Audi-care and Carbon Fiber interior trim. It, with shipping, came to ~$57K; and I paid 94% of sticker (member of the Audi Club of NA, discount of 6%).  At my own option, I have doubled the # of oil changes (I go in every 5,000 miles, meaning I pay for every-other oil change.) I have had the car mini detailed twice and a full-on inside and outside detail once (in the 22 or 23 months since I got it). I swapped the OE tires for Conti's Extreme Contact DWS/06's a couple thousand miles ago and the handling took a very big step up and road noise, already low, dropped even further.  I would get another one -- without any question (assuming the price doesn't shoot up like Cadillac did to the CTS line). I see no reason NOT to keep it until at least 90,000+ miles (based on its complete lack of any issues, thus far.)  I have no clue if these cars hold their value better than or worse than whatever they might be shopped against -- my sense is at $57K, I would have had to take a lesser-contented BMW 335i x-drive. We've had 3 BMW's and this Audi feels more powerful than any i6 BMW we've had, but since the Audi is supercharged, this may not be a fair comparison.  I wish the back seat had at least 1"" additional leg room, but since my 22 pound Sheltie is usually the only rear seat passenger, it is not really a show stopper; besides the next gen ""A4/S4"" family will grow in size somewhat, so, again, if I knew then what I know now, I would, without hesitation repeat the acquisition of an S4.  My complaints -- ONE; the car came with WiFi based on T-Mobile 3G technology. If I actually could find and keep a 3G signal (instead, mine is mostly at 2G), I would be fine with the WiFi performance. Ultimately, my dealer showed me a secret method of adapting the carrier from T-Mobile to AT&T with some software coding and a new SIMM chip -- I am now, always in 3G. I read somewhere that the 2016 A4/S4's will offer 4G LTE radios, solving the T-Mobile (in our geography) performance issues.  Love the feature of being able to Google a destination by voice and having the sat nav take you there -- all hands free.  Love the instant response of the power, the 7-speed DSG and the tuneage from the B&O speakers.  Regrets? Wish I had gone the extra $1,000 for the Sport Differential (Audi's name for torque vectoring).  After driving an S4, you will -- upon sliding behind the wheel of almost any other car -- wonder if the different car than the S4 is, somehow, broke. The 3.0T motor is damn near electric in feel as it whisks you effortlessly from 0 to 60, just about the time you reach the end of your . . . driveway. Ruh Roh!  Hope this helps.  P.S. I am not too much of a believer that ""new models"" are prone to first-year glitches; I am a believer, however, that often the last year of a model's life-cycle provides the least amount of problems, often the greatest amount of content for the dollars spent and a pretty good chance of a deeper discount since there are no secrets. In other words, there will be a new, B9, A4/S4 model -- MY 2017. The 2016's, therefore will have to have more content and a better deal in order to help dealers clear out the ""old"" inventory thus making room for the new. Audi, I believe, has taken to delaying the availability of the new model until a certain threshold of sales of the old model has passed, therefore providing some ""value support"" both for the dealers and ultimately, of course, the buyers.  Discounts will be there for 2016 A4/S4's -- but don't expect to see a $58,000 S4 for $48K just because there is a new 2017 in the pipeline.",bmwi helps 3g big dont issues 48k meaning feel complete bo behind weve name almost dealer motor leg i6 breld really dsg chip deal pipeline doesnt another deeper line audi subaru comfort even step repeat new 2g 23 set hope order report far 57k comparison often aspiration audiide taken sticker 7performance passenger instead memercedeser would gen different tuneage shopped extreme believer actually cars simm performance got 58000 miles showed dealers go red beaudier lte like contact hands expect mechanical size thousand feels free safety performance detailed providing old near brands take premium styling audicare feature destination carbon came provides words sales dws06s changed months making delaying shoot detail performance bmw00 mmiconsole fullon vectoring carrier family limit full sound adapting grow two secret availability swapped keystroke said driveway devices wonder consoles 1000 since year gone time outside inside isnt 2016 oe course paid option already nothing performance cts based car console hesitation clue driving therefore litacurae damn nissantely complaints springing 90000 systemspeakers lifecycle twice low software threshold negative brand acquisition response efforacuraessly regrets perfect see audi4 much greatest pay 4g glitches couple support club dropped shipping bmw oil technology 94 2016s last love took 30t trim mini usually show driveability inventory wifi firstyear whisks top tmobile always doubled coding secrets electric read performance somewhat get ruh price fiber mosacuray instant reach pound certain comfort everyother nissanion somewhere aaudi rear lack north clear dollars assuming alcantara contis discount signal somehow content plus fine fair broke comfort sense speakers amount comfort stopper chance method could road voice 6 1 5000 keep secadillac extra every differential next able inserts performanceful value 60 lessercontented back reason supercharged know audi4s thus however least respect early mine sheltie changes problems upon performance geography offer google 3 good hold cadillac na believe without might knew device 130performance may performance passed discounts ordered sat besides efficiency roh whatever prone worse preaudiy solving perhaps spent end buyers performance 0 assist change find additional help ago 2017 one sliding ps 22 noise

2030,"August 15, 2015  2:08AM",markcincinnati,"I had a 2005 A6 3.2 -- it was TorSen. As far as I know, all [quattro] Audi's that use a ""north south"" engine (longitudinal) are equipped with a TorSen system, not Haldex. Audi TT's and some A3 models (and VW golfs) had east west engines and utilized Haldex mechanisms.  Early Audis with the TorSen system were 50 50 torque split, Haldex systems were typically 90 10 (F R) splits.  In the US, at least, almost all Audis sold for the past couple of decades have been quattros and almost all of them have been TorSen, culminating in the cars using TorSen having a REAR biased AWD design. The sport differential (rear only) further enabled Audis so equipped to mitigate the understeer prevalent in cars (like Audis) with their engines ahead of the front axle.  TorSen AWD systems have many positives but at the cost of added weight.  Currently Audi continues to balance the weight of many of its cars to be less nose heavy than in the past.  As far as I know, TorSen AWD systems are the only systems that ""bind in real time"" -- meaning they do not react, they just act -- essentially eliminating the torque shift lag time of other reactive systems.  In day to day use, I have to wonder, however, if most of us mere mortals can actually tell the difference between symmetrical and asymmetrical (rear biased) systems -- although I do believe it is quite possible to tell you're driving an essentially FWD car that happens to be able to shift power aft (Acura and Volvo spring to mind).  Even so, an Acura TLX with SH-AWD can do a pretty good imitation of an S4 much of the time -- in the clutch, so to speak, however, the FWD biased systems often still feel more FWD than AWD to me.

I assume the possibility and perhaps the probability that Porsche and Lambo may ""do awd better than Audi"" but the thing is, even these two super-car brands are all part of the same family. The Lambo system appears to be in a leadership position what with electronic control of all three differentials.  But, my ""assertion"" was in the context of the LPS and ELLPS world we rage on about here on this forum.  Techie in nature:    More entertaining and a bit of a history lesson:    Here is another assertion, but this one is not based on any experience or real study of the brand:  In the class of cars (""economy car"", according to Car & Driver) Subaru typically is placed, Subaru does AWD better than any of its competitors. My only reason for such a conclusion is that Subaru has demonstrated its almost fanatical dedication to AWD and, over the years, at least one of its cars, the WRX, has been praised as the Japanese S4.  The differences and similarities are discussed and dissected here in this comparison of a 2015 WRX to a 2010 S4.

It is also true that Audi has been doing this for decades (in some cases decades longer than other's in its class), meaning others have been at this nowhere near as long.  Yet technology has progressed sufficiently that the market may not perceive anything more than subtle differences between Audi's, BMW's, Lexus', Volvo's or Subaru's approach to AWD; but those who make their living knowing about the differences and the subtleties, regularly praise Audi's approach as very significant and often superior. Of course, in all fairness, many of the enthusiast magazines and their editors and staff now spend more ink describing the overall performance of the cars they review than they do on describing and detailing how one AWD choice differs, is better or worse, than another.

2043,"August 13, 2015  1:14PM",markcincinnati,"   http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/08/12/cadillac/31518823/    A Day in the Life  Due to our on-again, off-again “hobby” – getting educated about a somewhat eclectic number of automotive brands – my wife and I have had the experience of visiting dealerships and interacting with many current auto models and their sales representatives. Included in this list: Jeep, Chrysler, GMC and, of course, Cadillac. Of course we’ve also experienced Acura, Audi, BMW, Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes and Volvo, too. But, in response to DeNysschen’s “warning” to GM’s top brass, I can now reflect on what seems to be a different “approach” prospective customers will enjoy when shopping at the dealership of, apparently most, American automotive brands.  Have you ever heard of or seen a TV show called “WKRP in Cincinnati?” If so, you will have a somewhat more well-rounded perspective of the Herb Tarlek approach. I want to make sure you understand my remarks are a caricature – an exaggeration. You see, Mr. Tarlek is the sales manager of the fictional Cincinnati radio station WKRP – and he is, well, terrible. His behavior qualifies him to be called either a jerk or a jackass. His behavior and customer’s interactions with him often seem vaguely slimy, borderline unethical and disreputable. Further, it appears that Mr. Tarlek has a problem with women, often calling them “hon’” and usually ignoring them altogether, if they are with a man.  Pulling into the lot of [even] a Cadillac dealership, the gentleman sporting a white belt and white shoes barely allows customers to exit their vehicles before invading their personal space and asking them if their “time-frame” is today (since he’s already below his quota and needs to only spend time with customers who will sign and drive NOW.)  Then, you are guided to – apparently – the vehicle with the spiffs on it and “encouraged” to take a test drive. You are required to allow your driver’s license to be photocopied and you may even have to produce proof of insurance. Then, the rep gets into the back seat in order to answer any questions that may arise during the test drive.  And so it goes – you can’t wait to get out of there, for, during the test drive the chatter from the back seat is incessant, pressing you for “what’ll it take” to get you to close the deal today.  Come to think of it, this isn’t as much of a caricature as I had intended.  I don’t know if these dealer reps ever shop for cars anywhere else to “see how it is done elsewhere,” but the evidence suggests this is not the case.  On top of way too many dealers, DeNysschen has his work cut out for him – I suspect he’ll be incredibly popular with the dealers (uh huh).  Unless I knew exactly what I wanted and could pretty much handle the entire transaction over the Internet, I don’t know why folks willing and able to plunk down sums often way north of $50,000 put up with this kind of behavior – oh wait, apparently not enough of them do.  Swallow your pride and see if there’s any openings at Audi, Mr. DeNysschen.

I suspect there may be other ways to do this, but, one more thing: if a credit check is run through one of the three commercial CB's, there is an ""inquiry"" posted to the formula used to determine your score. Should you have a credit check or worse, multiple credit checks, there is the distinct possibility of a hit (negative) on your scores.  Applying for a credit check -- especially without your knowledge would not be a good practice.  Please note, my comments were meant to suggest a fundamental difference between the experience we customers face at a Premium European or Japanese vs even a Premium American brand.

I don't think it's the guy's ego problem. If anything, it's GM's past and present hubris and running the brand to the ground, before he even joined them. They guy is simply telling how he sees they should look in the future. He may be wrong here and there and perhaps not fully get all the fixes right, but it's simply unsustainable the way it is right now. The problem is the constituency, both in the company and the dealers simply is too myopic to see it and attached to old ways. In essence, he has no chance, not because his being wrong, but because there is too much to change and too few interested in the change.

That is not going to happen. The buyers of those cars are loyal and dedicated, and very few of them will ever consider a Cadillac—especially if it costs more money.  I'm trying to figure this out, but I see from GM's webpage (and even though he's spending their money hand over fist on his experiment, he's at the same time trying to distance himself from them?) that he grew up in South Africa. He also, as we know, worked for a long time for Audi, and then for Infiniti.  http://www.gm.com/content/gmcom/home/company/aboutGM/GM_Corporate_Officers/johan_nysschen.html  Essentially, Johan de N. doesn't seem to have much of a clue about who buys Cadillacs. The Cadillac buyer wants American luxury, performance, and style—but not at a nosebleed price. They either won't pay that much—or can't.  Cadillac has already moved upmarket in the last 15 years. And that's a good thing. But these new moves don't seem rational to me or to some other people.  For instance, would Audi owner markcincinnati be willing to pay *more* than an Audi for a Cadillac?

2054,"August 13, 2015  7:19PM",markcincinnati," Had the car for 6 months -- has 103K miles on it (how many did it have 6 months ago)? What was paid for the car 6-months ago (was it picked up below retail market? If so, how much below retail market)? Let's just say it was picked up from a private individual ""as is"" and was offered up at $2K below retail market -- that would suggest a still healthy but less so investment of ""only"" $3K in repairs vs what could have been, should have been, etc.  Are we counting such things as ""tires, brake pads, struts, rotors, cabin-filters, wheel-alignment and wiper blades"" as repairs? The last time I had to pay for a cabin filter it was a multi-hundred dollar affair, all in.  Is this car this person's first BMW or first high-mileage European car? My neighbor with 80,000 miles on a Pontiac (don't know the age), said the car was a money vacuum, in that it sucked all his money out of his checkbook. Most folks, these days are WARY of buying high-mileage cars that are breathtakingly expensive to repair and maintain.  And: How many times have we here said European cars are breathtakingly expensive to own out of warranty? Answer, about 139,659 times on this forum alone. Of course, you can be forgiven if you didn't read this board backwards to 2002. Really, we'll let that pass.  Key question, was a full, complete, total, non-free inspection performed on the car prior to purchase; if so what did the inspection reveal -- you would think such an inspection would've picked up something that would have caused it to burn through $5K worth of ""repairs"" (see maintenance comment above), perhaps?  Whenever anyone I know asks me for my advice or opinion regarding a used-car purchase, I typically urge them to spend the money for a non-biased, not-free inspection from a specialist enterprise. Here in RiverCity, there are several BMW or German or European repair houses (not dealer affiliated) who for a 3-figure number will put together a report on the used car you are lusting for, outlining the expected near term costs of ownership.  I always seem to get someone here upset at me when I suggest it is often far cheaper (on a 12, 24, 36 or even 48 month basis) to lease a brand new, with warranty (and often maintenance-included) car than it is to buy a used one with the potential of requiring huge sums of money just to keep it running.  What would a 2007 335i go for? Locally a new 3-series can be leased often for a number beginning with a 3. Often Accords can be had for even less, try $219/mo for a strippie for 27 months.  And (if it is a BMW) that mo/pmt includes the maintenance and free (well, you know) repairs for 50,000 miles. It seems to me to be hard to compete with these sub-vented leases, unless for some reason you think you are making an ""investment"" in a declining-value asset -- and even with BMW's that's a hard argument to win.  Going to an Accord, per se, is not a bad thing or a dumb thing to do -- in fact, such a move may very well be a good and smart thing to do; but unless the Accord in question is 100% new with factory warranty and any mntce program that may accompany it, the same rule of thumb would apply -- get the damn thing rigorously inspected before buying/leasing/financing/acquiring.  Some of us are ""types."" After dozes of German cars, my wife and I each went with Infiniti [her] and Acura [me]; we liked the cars for the most part, but it was really quite difficult to build up much passion or, actually, any emotion. My cousin, ""Mr. Honda or Mr. Mazda and now Mr. KIA,"" tried out a German and, although it was no trouble, he just seemed to resent (?) the fact that he had to interact with the car -- he just couldn't get into the ""don't forget to breathe"" tag line sign hanging low and large at the local BMW dealership.  Maybe it is telling -- I am not certain ""what"" it is telling, however -- that the BMW's ouster will be followed not by another German or European or even Premium car, but by a Honda Accord. Again, there is nothing wrong with Accord's, but I would typically think folks who like BMW's unlikely to shop Honda's.

2081,"August 12, 2015  1:06PM",dino001,"I'm not against platform sharing, that's a fact of life today. It's about making cars different enough. There are examples of successful platform sharing, such as VAG, where to various degree there are shared components between Skoda, Seat, VW, Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini and Bugatti, but the brands have enough identity and uniqueness between each other. A domestic example of a successful platform sharing would be Cadillac Escalade - regardless how much detest Cadillac's marketing of this vehicle (the commercial with Pharao, Raja, Louis-X??? could easily be in top 3 most offensive and obnoxious ever), it has enough separation from GMC. An example for the opposite also comes from Cadillac - Cimarron.  GM's overall track record of putting different badges on practically identical vehicles makes me, should I say, skeptical. They got better, recently. I think Buicks seem to be regaining their own identity, but seems GM is slowly falling back into its old ways - unrealistic expectations, lots of puffery, and lack of support of their dealers, see Graphic's CTS saga, which seems to stem from multiple dealers' unwillingness to troubleshoot the car without a fault code, which is most likely because GM's refusal to give them enough leeway to work the problem first. They can't win luxury market customers, if their dealers act this way, but they do that because of the toxic relationships. Moreover, there are probably too many stores for the brand to be truly upscale.  So they trump half million sales target in 5 years, which is high teens growth each year, every year, with currently crashing sales in some key US segments. I understand, big part of the growth is supposed to come from China, which I think is OK, even if recent news suggest a calamity unfolding there (I think it's way overstated).  How do you grow sales, when in fact you need to shrink the store count and apply more discipline? It's all completely inconsistent. As I said before, it's a ten year project with very difficult first three-four years and no guarantee for a success.

2082,"August 12, 2015  1:51PM",markcincinnati,"It -- perhaps superficially -- appears that Cadillac is emulating the SONY approach. Sony, a few short decades ago was the big buck TV (and later there were many other Sony branded electronics). Back in the day when big name department stores would sell TVs, a shopper could be in selection mode and see a sea of Zenith, RCA, Admiral and even Mitsubishi TVs -- often the Sony family of TVs was separated from the other brands; and, always the Sony brand in whatever size you were shopping for was more expensive. Time passed. Sony proliferated the brand and began lowering prices. Or did the competition creep their prices upward?  Eventually Sony showed up in Walmart along side other ""perceived lesser"" brands -- regardless of the price erosion, Sony did keep the image of being the Premium Brand.  Lexus, on the other hand, produced a premium automobile, said to be comparable to Mercedes, and charged 20% less. Over time, Lexus was able to inflate the MSRP of the cars to near parity with the premium Germans.  Two approaches -- both appear to work to carve out market share.  Cadillac seems to be working the Sony model -- price the product more dearly, take the chance that the market will perceive the brand in an increasingly positive light -- ""Cadillac is back."" This is time consuming, expensive and probably WILL WORK ""if"" there is sufficient shareholder and executive management patience to ""not quit before the miracle.""  The Lexus -- Land Grab -- approach also has its merits. In a B2C model, I would assume the Lexus approach seems ""intuitively"" to be lower risk. But, the brand will take a period of time to build up the desired perception. Again, corporate and shareholder patience will be required, but since there will be volume, shareholders may think the ""miracle"" is closer than it may ultimately prove to have been.  You can't enact either approach if your masters fire you though.  The investors -- a somewhat different group than the shareholders -- probably prefer raising prices, since the brand's equity (if the approach works) will certainly be built up.  Oddly, in my perception, Audi took the Lexus approach (sort of), but I could argue the ""unintended acceleration"" situation that befell Audi after the 60-Minutes story, FORCED Audi to discount their cars just to remain relevant in the US (remember the days when select prospects received a $5,000 check that could be applied to the Audi 5000 (which became the A6) linup. The approach would seem to be that the MSRP was not discounted, but you were given an up-front rebate.  So Cadillac is taking the approach of selling cars that are priced higher -- the Sony approach to market share, sort of.  Of course the dealer body has to be convinced along with the customers that this is a long game and worth playing. The dealers, so it appears, are not exactly warming to this approach, however.

I have no wish for Cadillac to emulate my historical perspective of Sony's playbook. I observed some evidence that was the approach that seemed to materialize coincidental with the birth of the current CTS.  For the most part, I would say I favor the Lexus LS400 approach -- build a comparable car (comparable to Mercedes is the popular conception) and price it so compellingly that it is difficult for customers NOT to shop it.  In some respects, it appears KIA has set its sights on the Premium (including entry-level premium) Class and is using the land grab approach. It's sibling company coming out with the Equus, too, seems like a similar approach. Don't know how it's going with the Equus as it, unlike Lexus, doesn't have a dedicated dealer body. That worked out well for the Phaeton in the US, eh?  My board is always after me to raise the prices of our software products -- doing so, we experienced growth -- slow growth. We changed the strategy to buy one, get one and sales (revenue) literally doubled. Of course my business is B2B, but in the end, the purchases are made by a human, in either a commercial or retail setting, so I assume there is some carry over.  If you want to build market share, go land grab and raise prices slowly over time. If you want to build gross margin -- PER TRANSACTION -- raise the price, but remember the risk is that revenue will likely drop for some period of time (years, in some cases).  The economic reality seems, for cars -- unless you're Lambo or Porsche, or another already high-priced established product, etc -- to favor land grab, if you're trying to build or, in Cadillac's place, re-build a brand.  I think, in part, BMW has mastered this -- they have created an aspirational brand. Everywhere you turn (we have two BMW dealers in Cincinnati who seem to churn out a couple hundred new BMW owners every month) you see ""yourself"" in [generally speaking] a new 3-series; then, when you've finally ""arrived"" you immediately go to the BMW Store or Sweeny and pick up your new symbol of success.  A few years ago, I read an article that said ""Everyone wants to be BMW;"" last year, if you can believe Car & Driver, et al, the headline was ""Everyone wants to be Audi."" Of course the ""Everyone"" was speaking of Audi or BMW's rivals du jour.

2094,"August 12, 2015  5:28PM",markcincinnati,"Technically the Macan shares about 33% of its DNA with the Audi Q5/SQ5. The two local Audi retailers happen to own Porsche dealerships -- kind of an interesting ""battle of the brands"" with shoppers cross shopping SQ5's with the base Macan. Apparently, if you know where to look, you can actually see the Audi markings on frame members of the Macan.  Of course my Audi rep thinks the Macan costs $10-$15K more than an SQ5, and has made a Sticker Comparison to demonstrate that.  Frankly, having driven both of them, my take is that for once the Audi interior is second to the Macan's and the Macan has noticeably lower ground clearance. From a power perspective, the Audi has both more HP and torque, but the Porsche's torque, derived as it is from turbo charging comes on at a lower RPM.  The SQ5, were it to offer the German Market lowered suspension (which it does not, here in the US), seems to be more car for the money -- but, ahem, what price the Porsche medallion? The Porsche uses a 7-speed dual clutch unit and the SQ5 uses an 8-speed tiptronic with software that does a pretty good impression of a dual clutch feel.  Lots of options available on the Macan -- and those options can crank a Macan over $100,000. Our lowly SQ5 Prestige with a couple of options and in Panther Black with red leather seats came in at $65,000.  Despite the similarities, there are obvious Porsche touches that are included in that 67% uniqueness -- and while you may argue their value-prop, they certainly do imbue the Macan with Porsche-ness; and, no amount of leather or paint will make the SQ5 a Porsche.  You may cross shop them and I'm certain the country-club valet will give either car you hop out of nothing other than a ton of respect (and will likely avert his eyes), but one, after all is a friggin' Porsche.  Drive it like you live.  NB: My wife decided the SQ5 would be a repeat, primarily because she likes being a bit higher off the ground and because the back seat of the Macan takes a big hit in headroom and cargo space in exchange for having a swoopy rear-end.

2100,"August 10, 2015  9:09PM",markcincinnati," Sometimes I just cringe when someone calls me sir -- I think it heralds the beginning of the end.  I was driving into the office today and made an attempt (1/2 hour commute) to note the age of the driver of every Mercedes I saw. I only saw E's and S's, but I did see a double digit number. I did not make any attempt to categorize by gender or apparent ethnicity. My memory says I saw only two ethnic groups represented ""black and white"" -- and of course two genders.  What struck me was the apparent fact that the E's and S's were all AWD versions and were all driven by what certainly appeared to me to be people beyond their 50's. Is this observation in any way statistically significant? Probably not, but it could be, at least, an interesting data-point. I drive through mostly upper-middle income neighborhoods on my commute, FWIW.  Before you think I've gone off some rail here, I was having a conversation with a friend about cars and the subject of Cadillac came up -- his comment was that they remain cars that attract ""mature"" owners, retired folk, apparently in his view.  The article above about the efforts of the new Cadillac President to change the behavior (mentality) of dealers made me think he was onto something. Cadillac dealers don't act like Audi, BMW and Mercedes dealers -- and they still paint prices on the windshields of the cars on their lots (I make it a practice to avoid dealers who paint prices on the windshield of the cars on their lot, I fear them, frankly.)  My perception is that BMW has the youngest drivers of the German Premium Crowd, closely followed by Audi (but that may be because of the Q5's success -- and that it would appear Q5's have a relatively young owner-set.) Audi, too, with the A3/S3 may be trolling for ever younger owners.  But, that still leaves me with the observation -- this morning -- that the E and S class Mercs were AWD and all driven by, apparently, Baby Boomers, current Xer's and Millennial's weren't participating this AM, at least.  Here I am 64, driving an S4 -- I guess I should be in what -- an A6 or CTS or perhaps a 5 series or should it be an XTS Cadillac. Wondering what, if any, studies of the age of owners exists -- with all the focus on Millennials and away from us Boomers, these days, it would seem to be some valuable data.  Ever notice the current crop of Buick ads wherein the ""little ol' lady"" remarks ""Oh MY!"" when she is told she's in a new Buick. Is that a nod toward the past or is that a convoluted way of suggesting that new Buicks will be appreciated by those of a certain maturity and perhaps even attractive to them?

To have a really good understanding of what the majority of ages is, you would also need to know the mode, median and range -- to get a better idea of the number(s) that occurs most often. The issue with mean is that a bunch of 45-ish year olds buying a certain car would return an ""average age"" around 45, as you would expect; but, throw in a couple of purchases by some 25 year olds and a few more over 75 and well, depending on the size of the population, you could skew below or above 45 even though the population as individuals is ""over half"" 45-ish.  I was quite surprised to see the average age of BMW buyers was ""THAT OLD!""

I went the Audi route when all my friends went with BMW's because #1 the Audi brand had quattro and #2, I always felt you could buy the next higher line of Audi for the same price as the lower line BMW, so I thought the value and performance leader was always Audi (you could say, too, I guess, I was, ahem, more frugal than my BMW lovin' friends).  But back to the math -- an average age of 60 does not mean the majority of buyers are over 60. There isn't enough information to know, if all you know is the ""average."" Mean, Mode, Median, Range and while were at it Standard Deviation, on the other hand would paint a much clearer picture of the number of ""old timers"" buying a particular automotive brand.

There’s a big problem though: Cadillac’s dealer-incentive programs today are designed to do just the opposite. One makes cash payouts for growing sales; the other attaches up to $700 in dealer bonus money to every vehicle they order from the factory.  De Nysschen, Cadillac’s president, says those programs must change for dealers to adopt a true luxury mindset, one based on an engaging customer experience, rather than sales volume.  “The business model has been structured more for the bigger brands inside General Motors, rather than the small Cadillac brand,” de Nysschen said here at a test drive event for the media. “The luxury business is different.”  He said Cadillac is in talks with its national dealer council “to develop the next generation of what these programs should look like for Cadillac.”  It’s an example of the obstacles de Nysschen faces in reshaping Cadillac’s retail network into something that more closely resembles those of German luxury brands such as BMW or Audi. Most of Cadillac’s more than 900 dealerships are hard-wired to carry far more inventory than other luxury stores, often moving the metal through deep discounts.  A Midwest Cadillac dealer, who didn’t want to be identified discussing factory business, believes it would be difficult for many dealers to fathom an incentive program that’s not tied to sales performance.  “There’s only one thing that matters, and it’s selling more cars,” said the dealer, who said he sells a couple dozen Cadillacs a month. “I did not come in here today to buy more digital stuff for the showroom.”  (more at the link)",2015 progdodge cadillacs pm comfort inventories big structured month president sells tighten rather volume digital national obstacles brands event progdodges ’ every 700 next dealer moving discussing opposite main brand sales factory “ money lake bonus news designed resemercedesles many true stuff media dozen develop another story generation small quash couple believes adopt performance test audi must nysschen retail midwest deep drive payouts bmw mentality dealerships feed selling cadillac engaging colias order german want council makes automotive showcomfort far look elements two reshaping fathom link inventory maaudiers 154 come dealerincentive said stores difficult often hardwired discounts though today incentive aaudiaches wis johan ” vehicle cash would different sellatanycost inside carry bigger plan haudipwwwautonewscomarticle20150807retail150809864cadillacworkstorevisedealerincentives business image example et cars rehabilitate buy general change customer identified closely august dealers something problem motors talks experience elkhart growing says one like thing 7 based faces network metal mindset 900 tied rss mike de

2137,"August  8, 2015  4:32AM",markcincinnati,"8 Years? Really?  Check out this headline: ""Knowledge Doubling Every 12 Months, Soon to be Every 12 Hours""!  While you're at it, check out any number of sources on the subject line ""Moore's law"": The observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years.  ""Buckminster Fuller created the “Knowledge Doubling Curve”; he noticed that until 1900 human knowledge doubled approximately every century. By the end of World War II knowledge was doubling every 25 years. Today things are not as simple as different types of knowledge have different rates of growth. For example, nanotechnology knowledge is doubling every two years and clinical knowledge every 18 months. But on average human knowledge is doubling every 13 months. According to IBM, the build out of the “internet of things” will lead to the doubling of knowledge every 12 hours.""  OK, so where oh where is this going?  This is going to the subject of why the refresh cycles of cars (German ones at least) seems to be (especially for Audi and BMW) 8 years.  Sure there are ""mid-cycle"" refreshes, but often what happens is some minor styling tweaks, perhaps an MPG increase and certainly an increase in ""content"" -- but, often content increases annually (sometimes for a bump in price) anyway, or at least there is a rejiggering of option package features.  What if Apple came out with a truly new phone once every 8 years? What if Lenovo or Dell only coughed up a new PC or server even as long as every 4 years? There are numerous other examples across many products and brands that would literally just drop dead if they didn't substantially change (one likes to think enhance and improve) their products much more frequently than 8 or 4 or even 2 years.  Given current technology advancements, check that, given the speed (and frequency) of technology advancements how is it that several significant car manufacturers only really offer more than evolutionary changes every 8-years?  And while incremental changes continue in years 2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8, it is -- as far as I can tell -- literally impossible to upgrade your year 2 version with year 6 features, for any realistic sum of money (and in some cases it is less money to replace your 5 year old BMW with a new one than even dream of [analogy] pulling out the old SIMM chip and replacing it with a new one.)  So much of our cars DNA is based on software and a circuit board, why not allow the customer who wants to pony up the funds to upgrade his/her car's ""infotainment"" system for the one found in a newer version of his A4 or 5 series?  Is the only reason to not support an upgrade path the desire to sell new cars? Why can you keep your 20 year old aircraft current with the latest and greatest avionics, but your can't upgrade your 2 year old car's 3G wi-fi to 4G LTE for love nor money?  And the refresh cycle at 8-years? Really? Why does it take 8 years between ""versions"" of these cars? That time frame seems to me to be based on the past, not the currently reality.  I think it is time for the refresh cycle to be shortened -- I'd say, based on where things stand today, cutting the cycle in half would pretty much be a catch up move, not a pull ahead move.  The days of rendering umpteen versions of a new design in clay, destroying them and doing it all over again, are inefficient -- so much so that if anyone is actually still doing this, it would have to be almost literally ineffective.  I've seen some very impressive 3D-printing demonstrations that would seem to eliminate such by-gone days' practices -- the model upgrade can be dreamed up, coded and the printer turned on; model change costs can be slashed as can the time from thought to manufacture to market. No way 8-years is required to recoup the development costs.  Computer controlled machines can be changed to produce new body stampings, etc and every day it is not impossible to believe some engineer somewhere has figured out yet another tweak to improve both power and MPG out of the internal combustion engine -- to say nothing of alternative power-trains.  So, today's car is part mechanical, part computational, part software, part hardware -- I've kept my iPhone current, and so far each upgrade has been a real improvement. This technology is in our cars and it should be similarly updatable (the time frame, the cycle) and notable improvements should be regular and frequent -- not for free, mind you, but this 8-year cycle between serious product upgrades and updates is a practice that needs to be abandoned as soon as possible.",id ive 3g advancements upgrades cuaudiing product ok system ahead ibm almost 25 numerous annually dead day going money really sell thought chip approximately demonstrations another noticed realistic line increases audi 234567 even nanotechnology new types human path far sources growth significant often hyundai replacing hondaing mind would different 1900 things 18 transistors dna cant law oh controlled actually cars simm hardware performance numercedeser hours sure computer bump move dream lte upgrade products mechanical truly computational machines impossible efficiency todays free similarly several long old brands take came internet versions 13 lead aspiration needs 4 months changed many happens kept cases rates features sometimes examples umpteen knowledge regular cycle catch pc eliminate performanceer check less two midcycle allow updatable years iphone inefficiency analogy version apple year board 5 body time series latest frequency 3dprinting tweak days part cycles found option customer newer acurated nothing based car frequent stand incremental coughed market youre practices development tweaks refresh hisher say required subject real across past software half increase brand avionics seem continue phone 8 curve drop much certainly created greatest didnt 4g improvement support circuit funds bmw evolutionary technology alternative love 12 manufacture coded wifi reality observation ineffective doubled today average design clinical ii ” ones buick rejiggering dell price buckminster shortened likes recoup world package somewhere moores lenovo console war improve slashed rendering internal build minor content think dense enhance pulling refreshes costs 8years updates possible 6 printer server keep produce soon every practice wants manufacturers fuller frequenacuray impressive “ doubling abandoned reason still performance anyway least changes stampings literally simple especially offer notable believe styling tell substantially german yet pull performancetrains mercedesy sum destroying anyone preaudiy perhaps comercedesustion maintenance seems end serious turned figured example performance seen 8year way etc change fdodgee current 20 one desire improvements bygone headline 2 given currenacuray aircraft

2139,"August  8, 2015  3:15PM",markcincinnati,"Opportunity Lost  My suggestion was for a cycle of ~4-years, not 1. Also, the experience of driving the automobile is, as I noted, largely based on software and circuit boards. Engine bays can almost certainly house either the tried and true and tired 3.7L (Infiniti, e.g.) or a new cleaner, more efficient and more effective powerplant (make the new stuff available now, don't wait for a new body style, i.e.) -- the point is I was only partially speaking of ""retooling."" Moreover, now that machines make machines, the cost of retooling has decreased.  But again, my request is for a compression of time for updates to the brain, heart and lungs (so to speak) of the automobile; later, or less frequently if there is a retooling argument at play, the ritual ""skin rejuvenation"" and lipo-suction can be scheduled.  Let me give a few examples of ""improvements"" that probably don't required new sheet metal to deploy (and I'll use Audi as my poster-child since I am familiar with that brand):  o Audi will wait to offer LED headlights until the B9 model (A4), but the technology has been in the ""C's"" (A6) for a couple of years. I can think of no legitimate reason this feature was withheld from the market.  o Top-view monitor, as much, or more, of an advance as the rear-view camera, has been around for years -- Audi will wait for the B9 class debuts before they offer this.  o Driver configurable dash (EFT tech), it too will have to wait for the next generation car  o 4G LTE internet connectivity -- also will have to wait, and no upgrade path is offered for older 3G radios buried in the MMI's guts. This ought to be like opening up your laptop, pulling the hard drive and replacing it with an SSD (all for $150 or less) and enjoying the performance of a no-moving-parts storage system without having to buy an entirely new PC  The list of features that could make the car perform better, be safer, have better in-car entertainment, navigation and driver assist aids do not require much, if any, retooling, but they would allow owners to keep their car's systems, on a selective basis, as current as the owner wants.  Perhaps this has little to do with capability or cost (to both the mfgr and the customer), perhaps it really is a way to compel (or at least impel) ""the market"" (you and me, perhaps, at the micro level) to trade in, trade up or just ""get new"" -- perhaps the status quo is as we know it today, to imbue aftermarket providers (SEMA) with endless opportunities to sell their wares. Who knows perhaps the mfgrs and SEMA companies are in a symbiotic relationship (I doubt they actually collude, however).  It just frustrates the ever-lovin' crap out of me to be almost unable to keep my cars as current as possible. I'd like to be able to pick and choose some of this year's features and incorporate them into my otherwise fine 3-year old.  Seems like you can put new wheels and tires on your car with ease -- and W/T combinations can provide performance, safety and styling improvements -- I just believe we have reached a point in time and technology where we ought to be able to do the same thing with the ""technology package"" most cars come standard with, these days (speaking of the PREMIUM CLASS, of course, for this and other posts).  A really big clue, to me at least, as to the lost opportunity mfgrs are ""enjoying"" is revealed over on audiworld.com where members breathlessly enthuse about the arrival (yesterday or the day before) of their new cars, then, in the next sentence, conclude ""Let the modifications begin.""  Lost opportunity if you ax me.  Sort-of unrelated: I finally met my very first non-Apple employee who was wearing an Apple Watch. As she explained it to me, it sounded pretty cool -- until she told me, that if you wanted to do almost anything other than tell time, you had to have your iPhone within about 30-50 feet of your wrist; meaning, effectively, you have to carry the phone to get much, if any, use out of the watch's smart features. I'm hereby volunteering to have an iPhone implanted -- with a charging plug inconspicuously positioned somewhere on my torso. You see: I'm looking to have empty pockets -- while they're at it, they can implant my smart car-key too (Audi keys are about the size of a small potato, for god's sake); I'd rather the car key be included with the car as a stylish and functional Mont Blanc pen.

Compared with those, 3-series is a picture of bargain-priced value (it really isn't, but in comparison to MB everything looks like one).  Sure, C-class looks better inside, but almost nobody buys 3-series for their interiors (if anything, those have always been deterrent rather lure). C-class is bigger, but that's not necessarily a good thing in ELLPS - those are not bough per pound or cubic foot.  It's a fine vehicle, if you like that sort of thing, but it is priced just silly. If you break down pricing to the car and the logo on the hood, it seems to me they charge for the star about double or triple of what BMW does (and admittedly BMW charges double or triple of what Acura does). In other words, the star on the hood costs literally thousands of dollars.

2145,"August 10, 2015  2:00PM",graphicguy,"Dino, I've been on a couple of test drives in the new C Class. Pretty impressive, IMHO. Certainly the interior is the best of the class bunch. I do agree about the MBTex vs Leather. Some say you can't tell the difference. I certainly can, and it's not even close. That being the case, the real leather of the one I drove with the sport seats was of high quality.  I do think that the Turbo V6 is a bit of overkill in the car, but it does compare favorably to a 335i or S4. Perhaps that's because the turbo 4 is so smooth and responsive in the C300. The C400 I drove came in at the mid $50s. The C300 in the low $50s. Pricewise, I don't think the Mercedes is disadvantaged at all against the 3 Series or A/S Audis similarly equipped.  The dealer that I talked to said he'd take 10% off MSRP off any C he had in stock. That was a couple of months ago. So, not sure if it's still the case, but that makes a very, very nice C Class price extremely competitive.  NYC...one of the ones I test drove was a metallic grey C300 sport with the lip spoiler and front chin spoiler. It had red leather sport seats and the open pore wood accoutrements....very sharp.

Test drove several S4s this past weekend (couple used ones and a couple new ones, manual and automatic).  Also looked at a 328d wagon and a 428i gran coupe (x drive).  Wife and I both have historically been very pro-BMW. But ours have almost all been more ""enthusiast-oriented"" (wife had a wagon much like dino's (m-sport manual)), and neither of us are getting too excited about the current models. The 328d wagon I drove felt somewhat ordinary. To be fair, it wasn't as equipped as we would like, but nevertheless it had a sticker of $55k.  The 428i I really enjoyed and do love the body style for its looks and functionality. The one I drove was a sport-line and pretty well equipped for the low $50k's. If I really checked the boxes for all the options I would like, it gets to the high $50k's pretty quickly.  So having said all that, I'm probably leaning more toward an S4. It's actually quite the value in comparison to some of the other cars I looked at.

For those of me who care about these kind of things -- headline:  ""Audi sets 55th straight monthly U.S. record with 20.8% gain in July 2015!""  If we start going back those 55 months, I believe we would come to a period where De Nysschen was at the healm -- the fact that things kept humming along after his departure is, I think, NOT an indication that the top guy doesn't matter, but rather an indication of how the products are perceived by the market.  As I dust off my graduate school marketing textbook (which is probably, by now woefully out of date), all evidence suggests EITHER to raise prices or increase market share by some method that leaves the perception of ""big bucks"" undamaged.  My leasing guru says: sub-vent the leases like there's no tomorrow, get the current product out and seen by the market; meanwhile work behind the scenes on getting products to the market that people WANT (translation Audi Q3, Q5 and Q7 rivals and BMW X1, X3, X4, X5 and X6 rivals).  If you ax me, the money spent bringing the all electric Caddy to market was a nice idea, but I don't see it as helpful to what ought to be the bread and butter ATS.  Isn't it true that for Audi THE meat and potatoes car is the A4 as the 3 series is for BMW? Shouldn't Cadillac at least consider doing whatever it takes to get ""a lot more"" ATS's in the hands of customers by almost any method (sub-vented leases being a good tool, typically)?  Or is it that the cars themselves just aren't ""gettin' it done?"" So no matter what you do within reason, some people will still say ""The Emperor Has no Clothes.""  One last random thought, the Audi dealer I shop is owned by a group that also owns a Cadillac dealership a couple blocks away -- so naturally, we do tend to browse that dealership since they know my wife and me as long time loyal ""dealer group"" customers. I have priced cars at the dealership and they are as stubborn as can be about the price they will use to run the numbers, whereas the Audi group seems willing to put the best deal on the table first. The experience at the Audi dealership is what I call horizontal sales, due to the fact that the sales staff is so laid back you have to wake them to get them to sell you the car; the Cadillac dealership still seems to employ a technique from yesteryear, with salesreps dressed in clothes one size too small and largely lacking in product knowledge beyond what they can glean just by looking at the sticker.

Most recently, he was scored by several dealers in New York who want him to make Cadillacs cheaper by offering more affordable leases and rebates.  If you ask de Nysschen, the main thing is to “do what’s right for the brand,” and doing what’s right doesn’t include cheapening a premium brand. But is it still the right thing to do when Cadillac sales are down 1.5 percent for the first half of 2015, while the luxury space continues to surge in popularity? Consider that Caddy’s international rivals – Audi, BMW, Lexus, and Mercedes-Benz – all enjoyed 7 percent growth or better in the same period. Once again, Cadillac is the outlier in its class, and de Nysschen may need to do more. For one, Cadillac has just one crossover despite the popularity of the class, and both the CTS sedan and ATS coupe are suffering in the sales race.  One tool Cadillac can use to turn things around, dealers contend, is to offer cheaper leases for its vehicles. In a Bloomberg special report, Potamkin Cadillac (Manhattan) general manager John Bruno related that the CTS once cost under $400 per month to lease. But now, leases are worth over $500 a month, or over 20 percent more expensive, and more expensive than what one would pay to lease a comparable BMW....""",never 2015 cadillacs id comfort free month president percent include consider related ask prices easy several cheaper fall premium ’ leases worth times although high main half brand guns around 15 sales “ crossover rebates thought see architect scored many still york coupe mercedesss continues need recenacuray sedan special pay cost crazy seemingly john lexus contend audi close aka nysschen potamkin space expensive comeback bmw offer new right hope cadillac offering manhaaudian lease want report suffering cheapening comparable – growth make period race may first bruno johan ” popularity surge would per seems enjoyed 400 things rivals international bloomercedeserg boss manager haudipwwwmodernreaderscomwhypay500amonthtoleaseacadillacwhenyoucanpaylessforabmw29485lorenzotanos mercedesmercedes pass general tool thinks sticks 500 use dealers grand acura turn ouacuraier allowed beaudier 20 one like thing 7 cts despite vehicles charge sad de affordable

2204,"August  4, 2015  3:12PM",dino001," Nearly negative 40 percent is a disaster, considering that ATS didn't even reach its midcycle upgrade and their initial stated goals for the volumes. ATS was supposed to capture the fallout of CTS sticker shock, but it seems it did no such thing - people simply walked away completely, they didn't get CTS and they didn't get ATS, either.  I wonder if that's just Cadillac's hubris, or a real strategy. For years good old GM was losing money on every car they sold and ""making up in volume"" , but that ""strategy"" was a road to bankruptcy. Perhaps they decided to simply acknowledge they can't sell as many cars as before, but through product improvement, they can reach some sustainable level of sales, albeit lower than before. One possibility is, if they are truly capable of having superior product and financially ready to back up lower volumes, they may attempt to hop over Germans, who are going in an opposite direction, by making their brand more accessible. How difficult is that? Extremely. Even if they can make a product that beats the Germans, the logistical problems are multifold - their dealer network is too big for the lower volumes of ""exlusive brand"", they would have to let go many (which costs money in broken contracts), they will need to shutter or repurpose plants (which costs money) and the risk is the downward spiral may still continue (people see sales falling so they don't wont to join the ""losers"" club). The previous GM had completely gutless management and militant unions, which made any real downsizing impossible. Not sure if the current one can pull it off - perhaps they can. The road to brand rebuild is long and twisted.  Cadillac has been a ""volume premium"" brand for many decades now. It was ""super rich"" brand only at its inception. By the time around 50s -60s it was a car not just for a millionaire, but also for the local dentist and lawyer. It meant higher prices than popular cars, but low enough so every midsize town could have a Cadillac dealership. It's not like Jaguar, where they always were a niche player with small network, except failed rebadge Ford Mondeo experiment.

Others may have something similar, but not the same. This is me - the color, the exterior, the interior, or these options. BMW used to boast that you could have something like 2 million combinations in their 3-series, just in the US market, this was before splitting off 4-series (I can't even imagine, how many you could have in Europe, when you have three times as many engines).  Some people are willing to pay for being different. X5/X6, A6/A7, BMW's GT or GC lines are all catering to those people. It's probably expensive to make those short lines of different bodies, so you have to pay to get them. I consider those ""butique"" lines an equivalent of special leather, Bang and Oluffsen audio, or other high premium options. Some people won't see a value in that (for you it's ""the same"" car), others will tell you that look is worth 10 grand.

2209,"August  4, 2015  5:11PM",markcincinnati,"Cadillac's push to raise the price of the CTS to -- I assume -- 5-series territory is not based on a bad theory, it is just that it was [obviously] too early. A CTS at a 3-series price probably could have/should have continued for a bit longer. Those wanting a CTS/5-series sized car were, I think, heading to Cadillac for ""premium+value"" -- isn't this what Lexus did from day-one?  Now, a buyer with a 3-series budget goes into the Cadillac showroom, thinking he/she might drive out with a CTS and gets a bit of a shock upon seeing the MSRP of the CTS. I imagine the buyer isn't interested in an ATS after his plans to drive off in an American 5-series for a 3-series price have been dashed.  I would also imagine the unintended consequences of the CTS being priced at 5-series levels would be the buyer just goes ahead and gets a 3-series or perhaps finds a ""Summer of Audi"" lease deal that is too good to pass up.  I think the CTS, at the same price as a 5-series, is, today, too much wishful thinking on the part of De Nysschen and his marketing team.  The market isn't ready, yet, to accept a CTS priced like a 5-series.  Pity.  And, whoever wrote about my purchasing proclivities is dead-on: While I would not pay nearly $10,000 more for an A7 when I could have an identically equipped A6 for less, I would gladly pony up the $10,000 for optional extras like leather, electronics, wheels/tires and other factory-exclusive customization.

Fair enough. My gut feeling is that former M5 owners might love this CTS-V if they gave it a true test, but I understand that what drives one person to purchase a six-figure (or nearly) German performance sedan might not be sated with a domestic badge. But the Cadillac certainly makes a strong case for itself when spec sheets are measured.  Take the previously cited competitive set from Audi, BMW, and Mercedes for example: The CTS-V has a clear power advantage over all of them. The M5 gives up 80 hp and 130 lb-ft, the RS 7 80 hp and 113 lb-ft, and the E63 by an appropriate 63 hp and 40 lb-ft. The Cadillac is the lightest of the bunch, undercutting by anywhere from 130 to 330 pounds, and only the all-wheel-drive Mercedes is quicker to 60, by two tenths of a second. But you'll have to pay out of the nose to get those tenths: the E-Class is about $17,000 more expensive, base to base.

2243,"August  1, 2015  3:53PM",markcincinnati,"""I Can't Drive 55!""  You must know by my id here that I live in Cincinnati. The SMSA of this city is about 1.5M the last time I looked. The city itself has a population of under 400K. Technically, then, most of us don't live in the city. I earn my living, however in the corp limit, as does my wife.  I drive to work -- or at least I used to -- on two interstates: I-275 and I-71. I have tried driving on these interstates at the early and late ""normal"" times, and find myself often putt putting along at whatever speed the car can manage ""at idle."" In winter, it is even worse.  I have now taken to driving on secondary roads and residential streets -- just to be able to get to 35MPH - 50MPH.  I am, currently, driving an Audi S4 -- a car that in the blink of an eye can almost reach triple digit speeds and the thing feels like it is on rails, making it a great hi-way cruiser, capable of an easy-peasy drive from Cincinnati to Columbus at speeds north of 80MPH.  I have not driven an RS7, I have driven a 2015 S6, however, and even that was somewhat frustrating since it is capable of feats of fancy that are virtually impossible on the roads I drive to go about my business.  I used to think if I had ""Trump Money"", I would certainly go for a super-car or at least an ""entry-level super car."" Not any more.  I really enjoy my S4 -- the few times I've been able to really push it, I have been impressed with its ""performance envelope."" I suspect I would find going back to a 2.0T equipped A4 a let down. But, I also suspect I would find moving forward with an RS4 (if a sedan version were to be made available in the US) would be a let down, too -- or at least immensely frustrating.  An unlimited bank account would allow me to acquire, for instance, an RS7 or whatever else might pass these days as a super sedan (an M5, too, would qualify). But what advantage would I have -- I rarely can use the full accelerative force my pedestrian S4 provides. Were I to attempt to ""punch it"" I would, more often than not, find myself overtaking and potentially ramming (""rig for ramming speed"") the pokey car in front of me.  Cutting yet another second+ off of my ability to accelerate would be -- in theory -- fun and potentially a safety feature (if you say it real fast and squint, 0-62MPH in 3.7 seconds could be a safety feature, couldn't it?) But, uh, REALLY? I think it is safe to say it is so highly unlikely I could ever use that much quickness, it would just be very, very frustrating. Heck, it is already frustrating with the ""urge"" my lowly S4 musters.  So, I have reached a point where I lust for the kind of performance that is available and, currently, unaffordable -- but I also balance that lust with the reality that it is not virtually impossible to use such power, it is literally impossible to do so.  So, I ask myself, why bother -- traffic is not getting any better, speeds are not getting any higher, abilities to actually use such accelerative force are waning as each day passes.  I'm just about ready to use public transportation -- oh wait, we don't have much of that here in River City, so I have to putt putt along in my ""entry level super sedan"" (well sort of), wondering what it would be like to, as my buddy says, ""punch it.""

2247,"July 22, 2015 11:23PM",dino001,"The trick was in the tax structure, favoring diesels. That tax structure was justified by a doctored science, making the diesel engine look like a savior of the environment (vs. evil gasoline engine) due to lower carbon emissions, with nitrogen and particulate data using emission tests that were set up to produce appearance of much lower emissions than real life. As a result, the measured nitrogen oxide and particulate levels in cities did not go down and they tracked it to the emission test overstating the reduction of those emissions. In essence, if new diesel emission standards were followed using real life tests (similar to those in the US), there would be materially fewer engines certified in the marketplace (just like in the US), and those approved would be much more expensive. Hence the ""con"". There are some other interesting particulars in diesel market in Europe - like particulate filters that are often cut out by rogue drivers, because their replacement is horribly expensive, which defeats the purpose of the filter (this is more Eastern Europe phenomenon than Western). Also, it has been well documented that durability of those new breeds of diesel engines is well below what it was before and the maintenance is horribly expensive. Premature failures of double mass wheels, emission systems (especially in situations of frequent short trips, when particulate filters don't have a chance to burn out), increased sensitivity to fuel quality, make those engines equally or even more fragile than gas engines. The old stinker could go for million miles on vegetable or heating oil, the new quiet, ""clean"" diesel, has a lifespan similar or sometimes shorter than the gas engine with higher costs of overhauls. The prices of diesel repairs of those new TDI engines at authorized garages are legendary over there (it's not unique to VAG, same happens to MB, BMW, Peugeot, or Renault).  European Commission is trying to rectify the emission situation by tightening the standards to resemble American, but the issue is of course transition time. I believe once new enforcement is in place and costs of engines go up, the proportions of diesel engines in small cars will revert to values similar to those prior the whole craze, which is more than in the US, but much less than today. The move is already happening, primarily due to equalized diesel fuel prices (that used to be much cheaper), observed increased maintenance cost and lower durability (majority of Europeans, even in the West buy cars for eight-ten years, not three or five), but tightening the standard will likely accelerate it.  Americans never caught that bug, partially due to unrelenting of the US government on nitrogen oxide emission requirements. From what I understand it was also California that was even more ""anti-diesel"" than the feds. When you had fifth of the market excluded, there was little incentive for the manufacturers to even pursue the technology. After 20 years of apparently failed European experiment, it appears this was one of the few times, US/California governments did something right, even if not knowing why.",west marketplace never fewer uscalifornia maintenance litacurae market burn trick dont commission enforcement efficiencyoline costs filter breeds happening particulars short chance overhauls prices government old could overstating cheaper excluded appearance prior million tax knowing experiment produce equally americans antidiesel favoring values frchevrolet times nissan styling governments real carbon appears lifespan european manufacturers failed similar american eastern due europe primarily interesting drivers feds levels systems making rectify much performance life happens situation craze phenomenon eighaudien california failures transition increased diesel evil purpose western sometimes cost small standard materially efficiency nitrogen data trying test unrelenting apparenacuray particulate double observed reduction lower especially authorized bug expensive even vegetable documented environment oil higher filters mercedes mass tracked new partially technology resemercedesle right set emissions vs shorter structure con believe diesels maintenances stinker followed approved whole look five less caught efficiency make proportions years quality place pursue measured often understand likely performances horribly us hence today quiet incentive clean tdi three well used performance time would equalized europeans savior cut result durability doctored justified situations course cars buy heating unique standards bmw miles renault garages certified vag issue already legendary go fifth something premature move 20 science one maintenancement like requirements also oxide tests trips essence majority tightening revert sensitivity frequent peugeot using cities defecadillac emission

2272,"July 28, 2015  6:22PM",markcincinnati,"Wonder what the % of manual transmissions delivered to customers is (and if there is any historical comparison available, what that might be)?  My wife and I purchased cars with manual transmissions up until 2005 when -- the cars that we wanted -- basically stopped being offered with manuals.  I did, mostly, enjoy my first 6-speed auto (a Tiptronic), but always wondered what the same car would be like with a manual. No way to tell, as a practical matter, anymore.  Then, I test drove the 2014 S4 with a manual and the 7-speed DSG (dual clutch ""automatic manual"") -- I found the DSG to provide all of the good things (except the actual depressing of the pedal) of a manual, but after a back to back demo drive (of both transmissions in otherwise identical S4's) I decided the DSG actually felt quicker, and it certainly could be a hell of a lot smoother. Moreover, I use the type of car washes where you give your car to ""the guy"" to drive through the tunnel, etc -- and I smelled a burning clutch and heard grinding gears one time too many, so I talked myself into the DSG.  Now at some 30,000+ miles later, I find the DSG to be the best transmission experience I have ever had, relegating my love of manuals to be my sentimental favorite, but not for the performance, I used to believe could only be achieved by rowing your own.  I am fortunate to also have another Audi an SQ5 with an 8-speed Tiptronic. Oddly, despite the torque converter, this iteration of the 8-speed is also better even than an S4's manual (there is no way to back to back test the SQ5 manual vs Tip since Audi only offers the SQ5 with the 8-speed.) But the 8-speed still has a hint, a vague suggestion really of being ""almost instantaneous"" making it sort of like the Coke Zero of Cola -- it's not Diet Coke, but it's not quite the real thing either.

The old A3 was light enough to be tossable as well and was excellent with the DSG transmission which had great tuning in '06 (maybe not the tuning a Toyota driver looking for a smooth auto would look for). Also, it was a sport package equipped A3 I had (sport leather seats, aluminum air vent rings, aluminum shift paddles, 10 mm lower ride height, stiffer springs, stiffer dampers; fog lights, spoiler on the roof, awesomely tuned for sporty driving).  It had little details with seemingly (at the time) no corners cut. Things like aluminum sills front and back, a power port in the cargo area, lighting for all areas of the interior, and the DSG learned ""your style of driving."" By the way I don't own the A3 because I sold it at about 8 years old with 106,000 miles on the odometer ($8K).  The new A3 is smoother, quieter, but not as raw and involving.

2278,"July  3, 2015  3:12PM",markcincinnati,"Jurassic Audi?  I am happy that Audi brought the A3 to market -- my assumption is this model will bring more customers into the fold. Everytime I visit my dealership, I make certain I get in whatever A3's are on the showroom floor. I must say, I think a base A3 without any options, seems out of place next to the RS7, S8, A6 TDI, and Q5's (and sometimes even an RS8) on the showroom floor, however. The higher contented (with sexier wheels) A3's just like the high zoot Q3's have no problem being a member of the family, however.  I have twice driven an S3, and I found them to be quick, powerful, almost visceral -- raw and rough around the edges. For $50K, plus $11 for the ear plugs that would be required, however, I would never buy one. Furthermore, firm is one thing, but the S3 in dynamic mode is harsh, more unrefined than any Audi I've ever driven -- until you get the thing above 90MPH, then it starts to make sense.  But, $50,000+ for an S3 -- which may not be too much considering the content and performance -- seems to put it out of the ""boy racer"" league, unless the ""boy"" has Trump as his last name.  The current S4 is showing its age, to be sure, but even though there is a new S4 looming in a matter of months, the current S4, for somewhat similar money, still seems far more refined and its supercharged V6 is sublime compared to the S3's sturm und drang.  The S3, to an older fart like me, reminds me of the first time my then boss let me drive his new Porsche 944 turbo. When I found out how much it cost, I just couldn't fathom why anyone would subject themselves to that much punishment just to be able to have a car that was supremely capable at triple-digit speeds (in an era when the maximum speed limit was 70MPH -- which we have, once again, returned to here in Ohio, thankfully.)  So, perhaps the A3 really is the refined ""little"" model deserving of the Audi rings; but, to me, as capable -- at speed and a caution to the wind driving demeanor -- as the S3 is, it seems almost more like something that should have been marketed by VW or had its roughest edges filed down and more sound deadening stuffed into every crack and crevice.  My remarks, it should be emphasized, pertain mostly to the S3, and entirely to the S3 when it comes to driving impressions. An upscale Premium+ or Prestige model A3 certainly seems to fit right into the family dynamic, and hopefully the driving experience does nothing but strengthen that perception.  The S3 is a fun car and one that from time-to-time could be a hoot -- a great romp, the Jurassic World Audi, perhaps.",rough deadening never driving remarks timetotime performance content plus ear market think ive league litacurae romp audis racer sense filed happy say jurassic could required performances ensafetyly visceral zoot und furthermore premium showing let tripledigit almost name subject every great next styling capable sublime twice able contented performanceful high brand marketed around upscale driven similar returned hopefully fold money really deserving age months supercharged hoot considering 11 dealership prestige 70performance much still fit however certainly raudi performance base sturm cost sometimes compared performance audi ever crack must even drive higher fart starts last new right thankfully family customers without assumption limit sound looming edges showcomfort far ohio plugs fathom make boy place may wind though crevice first couldnt maximum whatever tdi harsh perception raw anyone everytime 90performance time 50000 memercedeser would reminds perhaps somewhat get strenfordhen seems caution rings drang eperformanceasized 50k options mosacuray fun firm maaudier performance roughest certain boss brought stuffed buy world pertain punishment trump found sure 944 porsche quick current bring something problem nothing put sexier older experience unless one supremely like impressions dynamic demeanor thing visit refined car unrefined era comes floor mode volkswagen

2280,"July  8, 2015  6:44PM",markcincinnati,"How's Them New Taars? ""Taars"" mid-west col·lo·qui·al for ""Tires""  Hopefully this is somewhat of a public service, since I have no financial interest whatsoever in Continental Tires or The Tire Rack or The Audi Connection, despite spending money with all three entities.  The new shoes -- Continental DWS 06's -- have been on my '14 S4 (18"") and on my wife's '14 SQ5 (20"") for over 300 miles (in my case over 400 miles); and, today, July 8th, is a day befitting a duck -- steady, steady rain. The puddles have puddles, in fact.  This is really the first day I have driven with the DWS 06's on seriously wet streets, roads and highways.  Up until today, my report would have been entirely based on dry-pavement experiences. And, to put a finer point on things, the report I would give would have been easily rendered: Excellent handling, turn-in and bump absorption while being both quiet and comfortable (the latter qualified with the phrase ""for an ultra-high performance tire."")  I was in a big hurry this morning for a 9:30 meeting which required streets, secondary roads and two interstates to get to. Of course, it rains -- which, in Cincinnati, at least, brings out a driving behavior reminding me of the phrase ""deer in the headlights."" You see, Cincinnati drivers appear to never have seen rain, sleet or snow -- EVERY SINGLE TIME it rains, sleets or snows. This leads to -- hmm, seemingly endless (and unexplainable) backups when the coefficient of friction drops (like today) perhaps not much more than 10-15%. Such is life.  With some trepidation, therefore, I decided, initially, that ""ACD"" (assured clear distance) calculations had to be modified to make certain I could stop rather than ram into the ""deer"" ahead of me as he/she somehow managed to lose control of their car due to some standing water.  No worries.  The ""W"" in DWS (Dry Wet Snow) came through like a champ. The car continued to behave ""about as normal"" -- a rain soaked highway seemed little changed compared to a dry version of the same road, at least as far as I could tell behind the wheel. I half expected some earlier onset under-steer (and I'm sure it would be there at some speed) than on a dry road, but -- with my hand held high in the ""I swear"" position -- I didn't detect any even on that one curve I forgot about as I winded my way toward I-71S.  Another testimonial -- of approximately the same conclusion -- came from my wife, who was a couple of miles ahead of me (as usual) in her SQ5 with the same new shoes as mine; she and I were ""open lined"" with our mobile phones and with our traffic info nav screens set to 2 miles. She remarked how unfazed the SQ was under the circumstances. And, if you recall, she had just come from 40,000 miles on the previous gen DWS (sans 06) tires. For her the improvement in the DWS 06's vs the DWS is noticeable but not ""night and day"" noticeable; for me, on the other hand, coming from H rated Continental Grand Touring's, the DWS 06's absolutely have transformed the car into what it should have been from mile one.  Two comments on that:  #1 My fault, my bad, for not fitting DWS's on upon delivery (like we did with my wife's)  #2 Audi's fault, Audi's bad, for selling an ""S"" car with all-season Grand Touring H-rated tires; anything less than the latest and greatest all-season ultra high performance tires raises the question ""what were they thinking?""  Just because an American customer wants all-season tires, does not mean, nor does it even suggest, that the customer expects anything less than the highest performance tires available at the time the car is screwed together at the factory.  Clearly (to me at least) many folks on the other side of the pond don't get some American driver's choice to wear one set of shoes on the car year 'round. When we buy a premium sport-performance sedan -- and request all-season tires -- no where is it written that the performance capabilities of the tires should drop from ultra-high or max performance all the way down to ""H"" rated family sedan fitments. Yet, today's UHP A/S tires are a compromise -- but time and technology have advanced to a point where a tire like Continental's DWS 06 UHP A/S can provide a performance envelope virtually equal to and in some cases greater than some Max Performance tires.  I would not argue that these tires are fungible with any Extreme Performance or even most Max Performance tires -- but the DWS 06's give up virtually no ground to many other UHP summer-only tires and, as noted can sometimes match the performance of Max Perf models.  The moral, if there is one, of the story is if, like me, you don't want -- for several reasons, including ""wheel wear from tire swapping"" -- to change your tires back and forth between summer and winter tires AND you live in an area of ""moderate"" -- not heavy -- snow, these UHP All-Seasons are ""the best you can get"" [today] (until a better one comes along the day after tomorrow -- probably from Michelin).

This is similar to old EPA highway gas mileage, when those high numbers were obtained by running cars on a sunny day, with no wind, super even speed in an oval track, with a skinny driver behind the wheel, everything taken from the trunk, tire pressure set up at above normal levels, etc. Moreover, the carbon emission fetish (which was huge in Europe way before our administration caught the bug) lead to additional forbearance on nitrogen oxide, which is much more toxic to humans in immediate effect. Carbon is supposedly bad for the planet, so we have to prevent ourselves from being drowned in oceans, or suffering other horrible ""Inconvenient Truth"" death scenario due to temperatures raising by 2 degrees, but nitrogen oxide killing us before then was apparently OK. This whole setup was to made diesels look much better than they really were, and as such they were taxed at lower levels. All politics.  The regulators are looking now to made all emission testing realistic and using those values for certification process. The situations is reportedly so bad that, if implemented immediately, multiple models would have to be withdrawn from the market, which tells you how much skewed the setup was. Thankfully, United States government never bought into that diesel BS to the same degree. I also recall the difficulties with ""clean diesel"" implementation initiative (e.g. Navistar having to pay huge penalties on their engines because they couldn't make them compliant on time), I suspect part of that was that there was no forbearance on the testing.  I always maintained that Europeans bought diesels not by choice, but because they were made by artificial market setup. Also, American ""resistance"" to diesel was not as ""irrational"" as many people would try to make us believe. There is surely place for those engines - in agriculture, construction, heavy and midsize transportation, buses, perhaps on SUV-level. I think diesel Suburban, F-150, or even BMW X5 (or Honda Odyssey, if they made it) make perfect sense.

I thought, here in the US, that once the fuel was cleaner and with the advent of ""ad-blue"" that the only factor arguing against diesel being widely adopted was inertia.  The message that I have bought into is that diesels -- and this means the hardware and the fuel -- produce more torque and can often achieve some 1/3 better mileage than gasoline (around here premium and diesel are often close to each other in price.) In short, I have bought into the notion that diesels can actually be fuel sipping ""hot rods."" The SQ5 which is a terrific performer, is actually offered as a diesel in Germany, for instance.  When my S4's tank is full the ""miles to empty"" reading is 400. I assumed this would mean it would be at least 520 to empty if I had the diesel set up that is in the German market SQ5 in my S4. Based on the AudiUSA website (which, for example offers up a 3.0T A6 and a diesel A6) I assumed it would be a pretty simple calculation to estimate the asking price for an S4d (if one were to be made for the US market) and to then determine how many tankfuls until break even, etc.  That ""perception"" which I somehow seem to be reading in your post, may be part true, part myth. Please elaborate -- here's why: I have been against using ""food"" to make ""gas"" since some politician, I assume, started pressing for e85 fuel; conversely, it has always seemed that diesel engines in our cars could be a good bridge to a future where we actually can use less and less fossil fuel.  I read your post, however, and I wonder if I just drank some diesel flavored kool-aid some years ago.

2319,"June 29, 2015  5:34PM",dino001," That's right. However, there is a real difference between 320i and 328i in output, regardless of the engine size. Moreover, 320i/328i sold here are the same cars sold Europe with only differences due to market certification. However, US-market 328d was a pure badge gimmick. Europeans have always known diesels are more expensive to make, hence they have to be substantially more expensive to buy. Americans don't fully understand reasons for such a price premium in diesel-powered cars, so something ""badged"" as lower end (320d) would not sell at price that's even higher than mid-level 328i. Hence, 328d, not 320d as everywhere else in the world.  BTW, the European love of diesels is clearly weakening. Not that it's gone, but they are not seen as attractive as they used to be. Price of fuel went up so much vs. gasoline (unlike in the US, Europe had had cheaper diesel for decades prior last few years - that was due heavier taxation of gasoline, but now it got offset by higher market pricing due to heavy machinery and generator demand plus more stringent refining requirements), so higher diesel price was offset by better mileage PLUS cheaper fuel. Today, the latter is gone, only mileage is better, so it takes much longer to offset purchase price premium.

2324,"June 30, 2015  9:35PM",markcincinnati,"New Shoes  The '14 S4 I ordered came with the no-cost optional all-season tires. The tire specification was, on my part, deliberate since, living in Cincinnati -- the home of typically ""moderate"" winters -- I know I can't get away with ""summer only"" shoes year 'round. My previous A4 with the sport option came with 19"" wheels and summer only tires, which were great except for two things: 1 - they suck at any temperature below 40; and, 2 - the tread life of the Max Performance Summer Only tires that Audi chose was, optimistically not much north of 11,000 miles. This time, I thought I'd go with an S4 with the A/S's -- and I assumed since I was ordering an ""S"" car, the all-season tires would be the best of the best UHP A/S's on the market, probably Continentals or Michelins.  Bzzz! Thanks for playing, but the correct answer is that the tires on the car were ""H"" rated Grand Touring tires, albeit from Continental. The main characteristic of these GT tires was that they were very quiet. Otherwise they seemed out of place, somewhat, on an S4 -- the phrase ""under-tired"" springs to mind.  We had, prior to driving my wife's SQ5 off the lot had Continental DWS UHP tires put on the 20"" wheels, and these tires were (considering they were UHP A/S's) a true pleasure, the best of both worlds, if that is even possible.  So, here we are about 2 years later (my how time flies), she with 40,000+ miles on the SQ and me with 30,000+ miles on the S4 deciding that we had gotten what we wanted out of the tires on our respective S cars.  Meantime, back in the lab, Continental had updated the DWS tires and renamed them, slightly, DWS 06. Now, I have about 75+ miles on my new DWS 06 tires and the SQ gets its new shoes day after tomorrow.  For a 100% back-to-back commentary, we'll have to wait until we can drive in on DWS's and drive out on DWS 06's -- but my impressions of these tires on the S4 are from the context of driving in on Grand Touring slightly stiff sidewall tires and driving out on UHP very stiff sidewall tires (and, now that I've passed 50 miles, the slickness is gone).  The DWS 06's if you need (or want) all-seasons have transformed the responsiveness of the S4 from very good to ""I can't believe this is even the same car"" great. Additionally, these tires are even quieter than the outgoing GT's and even the ""jolts"" felt when hitting potholes are now, somehow, felt as if through some kind of energy absorbing compound (flubber perhaps?)  Here's the [current] bottom line:  These tires were designed to end ""your"" (and my) need to apologize for having all-season tires; there is quite a bit of explanation and detail that goes into what Continental did (or at least how their marketing department explains what they did) -- the sum and substance you can look up, but it all falls under the name ""Sport Plus"" technology.  SPT aims to provide drivers with much more precise handling (than any other UHP A/S tire on the market) and confidence and security on wet and/or slick surfaces, 35% stiffer sidewalls, and an even quieter ride than the DWS all with a 50,000 mile tread life warranty.  I'd say, thus far, their aim is true. These tires make me REALLY REALLY want to carve up the secondary roads I'm used to in my neck of the woods.  A set of four, for my S4 was $719.56 and was $908.96 for the SQ5 (S4: 245 x 40 x 18""; SQ5: 255 x 45 x 20"").  I had mine mounted and road-force balanced (plus a 4-wheel alignment) for $200, at the Audi dealer.  I plan to ""drive it like I live"" for at least another 40 - 45,000 miles.

2334,"July  2, 2015  9:20PM",markcincinnati,"Product Life Cycles: It's Time for a Change  The Germans -- and for all I know all of them -- produce new cars, not ""refreshes"", about once every eight years. My 2014 S4 is so very similar to my 2009 A4 (that I bought in third quarter 2008), it was difficult for me to actually see much difference, even though mine is a ""post refresh"" version.  Here is what this means: an A4 (and you can fill in the blank for your favorite make) available in calendar 2008 (in the US) is essentially repeated with continuous improvements in 2009, 2010, 2011,2012,2013,2014 and 2015, with a truly new car unavailable until calendar 2016.  Now, don't get me wrong, my 2014 S4 does have many seen and certainly many more unseen improvements over my 2009 A4. But progress, like time and tide, continues to advance -- and apparently the ""avionics"" are seldom unable to be upgraded, which leaves the last two and sometimes three years of a ""model run"" possibly out-dated.  It's no wonder the A4's sales (see post above) have dropped nearly 15% (and there have been decent incentives on this model, and it still manages to have a sharp sales drop off). The phrase often seen in the enthusiast's magazines is ""long in the tooth"" -- and that term is typically used after about 6 years after an all-new model is released.  Now, I'm not simply or just talking about the styling changes that typically go along with an all-new model, no, I'm talking about the wheelbase, width, platform, engine/transmission choices and technology advances, the features and functions (available inside the car) and even the audio systems and safety features.  Yet Audi, BMW and Mercedes seem hell-bent on this 8-year cycle as if they haven't yet noticed the last couple of years of a model's cycle see a big time sales decline. There is some historical justification for delaying the new model roll-out, and there is, no doubt, an economic reason for doing this -- at least there used to be.  Now, new technology -- which makes its way to cars faster and faster and more quickly than ever before -- becomes available about every 18-24 months, which should translate to cutting the 8-year cycle to 6 years, and, frankly, perhaps to 5 years.  Conversely, the rapidity of available [technology] change could argue for the automotive manufacturers to take a page out of aviation's play-book -- that is to allow us at least some reasonable ability to upgrade our car's ""electronic"" systems. Increasingly, our cars interface with ""us"" via software controlled devices. Furthermore, even when the new software requires upgraded hardware components, we should be able to swap out the old for the new.  I recently upgraded my relatively old laptop by swapping out a spinning disk-drive for a solid state drive and simultaneously was able to move from Windows 7 to Windows 8 -- and you don't need to get me started on the ability to keep upgrading the OS on my Apple devices; and upgrade my home theater from VHS to DVD to BluRay without having to buy an entirely new home theater system.  Airplane owners have long enjoyed the ability to, as I said, upgrade the avionics of their planes to conform to FAA requirements or to add additional functionality to their planes.  I understand the need to produce newly styled vehicles -- but I believe the life cycles have to drop from 8 to 6 to 4 or 5 years, especially if auto manufacturers remain unwilling to allow us to make some in-between model upgrades. Folks who want the newest styling will always want the newest styling would be my assumption.  Imagine if the new iPhone didn't come out for five years after the last one, or if we had to wait for UHD-TV because HD hadn't been out for at least 8-years, and so on.  Audi, BMW, Mercedes and all the manufacturers who have these impossibly long lag times between the introduction of new models need to get with the realities associated with the Law, Moore's Law, that is.",along decline decent translate big dont upgrades term im cuaudiing available product swapping realities system auto furthermore unable vhs introduction hellbent 20112012201bmw14 repeated aviations need noticed dvd audi ever bluray lag even functions mercedes new released newly want makes automotive width run faster difficult unwilling often os associated remain incentives would enjoyed frankly law controlled manages actually havent performanceperformance cars hardware tide 1824 ability impossibly go move like upgrade requirements third 7 magazines truly quickly apparenacuray console long old brands take requires 15 fill sales historical systems 4 months many life delaying 2010 features sometimes interface becomes drive possibly enthusiasts cycle 2009 economic five two allow come years said iphone devices add argue wonder version components rollout solid apple 5 time inside sharp 2016 state cycles 2014 increasingly allnew diskdrive car nearly germans advance refresh difference reasonable times advances upgraded software bought simply brand avionics stylingbase similar seem see 8 drop much certainly continues hd didnt couple justification dropped spinning bmw technology last safetyty conversely conform imagine make always airplane though us faa windows get essentially 2008 buy newest functionality home swap talking via moores playbook rapidity means blank 2015 eight upgrading quarter theater phrase started post refreshes typically 8years could leaves ensafetyly 6 keep produce wrong platform folks every able calendar uhdtv electronic manufacturers hadnt reason know relatively still progress least mine recenacuray changes owners especially uconsoleailable page believe styling without assumption yet planes simultaneously unseen understand continuous three choices styled used inbetween perhaps doubt seen 8year way laptop seldom wait change additional favorite outdated one tooth improvements vehicles

2352,"June 24, 2015  9:16PM",breld," Well, I don't know how much you want me to go into it.  I'm beyond the ""stepping up the food chain"" with my car purchases, and appreciate what different cars have to offer. On top of that, I change out of cars often enough that I'm only committed to a particular purchase as long as I am enjoying it, thus giving me the ""freedom"" to try different cars out.  When I say I am pleased with the change, it has nothing to do with directly comparing the BMW and the Mazda3 - perhaps that was misleading. For what type of car I was looking for, the Mazda really fit the bill well.  I was sort of in a large sedan mode with the 535i (xdrive), having also just come out of a Passat. But with a nice comfortable minivan as the family hauler, I had the freedom and yearning to return to something more on the compact, sportier side for my daily driver. I also was interested in a manual transmission. Such cars are becoming more and more scarce, and the Mazda 3 is a nice choice for those priorities (I also considered a WRX and Civic Si, but liked the overall balance of the Mazda. And my wife already has a GTI, or I probably would have gone that route). The Mazda is very engaging to drive, requiring driver involvement to best take advantage of its (relatively low by today's standards) 184 hp through the slick 6-speed manual.  I most frequently post on the CCBA forum, and those that participate there know me (and my habits) fairly well. Lest my current ride be taken as speaking out of place on this particular forum, I have indeed owned several ELLPS vehicles, mostly various 3-series. I've also owned three 5-series, one of each from the past three models (E39, E60 and F10). The F10, while superbly comfortable and sharp-looking, just didn't hit the same notes as my earlier BMWs - that wasn't surprising based on test drives; I knew full well what I was getting into. I just didn't realize how much I'd be longing for the increased driver involvement.  So, I went for the total contrast in the Mazda 3. Within a year or two, I suspect I'll land somewhere in the middle, having my eye on a 4-series GC once they start hitting the used market.",stepping id chain ive market todays sharplooking within dont minivan wife im post scarce looking say interested long several brands take mazdaudi advantage performance past misleading type low forum surprising yearning suspect various frequenacuray route really indeed side geaudiing know relatively much thus fit hiaudiing 3series earlier sedan increased 184 didnt went large land test overall nice subaru ellps return start drive bmw offer requiring 3 liked appreciate engaging family 5series full enjoying purchase daily ccba want wasnt e60 two comparing becoming eye come comfortable knew place top honda drives performance often longing ride taken si beyond three well priorities year gone try used superbly perhaps different pleased considered would lest speaking realize owned bill habits commiaudied giving direcacuray performanceier sort mosacuray hondaom compact fairly food gc probably aspiration cars hit purchases change standards mazda somewhere ill slick already go something nothing current total contrast 4series involvement choice participate one driver 6performance notes also enough based vehicles performance hauler car particular middle balance mode volkswagen

Not a ""bahn burner"" by any stretch, but peppy, with divine steering. Love the seats, too.  On the other hand, it's cramped. Certain features are just confounding. Overall, for high $40s all oaded up (and low-mid $40s discounted), you could do a lot worse. That puts it in the price ballpark of the TLX SH AWD ADVANCE. That's a tougher decision when you factor that into everything.  That C CLass and the interrior, and the ""smoothness"" of how it drives and operates, while giving up little in the way of ultimate performance can be had in the mid $40s range, too (loaded up and discounted).

The Lexus, especially compared with the Acura, was a bit cramped inside; but after having had a TL, everything seems a bit tighter, and I would quickly forget the relative girth of the Acura. Yet, the Lexus had a nicer interior than the BMW 3 -- of that I am certain.  I am finding out that I am not a fan of the north and south display screens (e.g., in the Q50 and Acura), it makes the interior look a bit chopped up.  To each his/her own on that count, though.

They are torquey and it's amazing to me how they've almost removed any turbo lag. But, some are a little coarse. BMW falls into that category (as does the one in the CTS).  Looking at the 335i xDrive equipped the way I want puts me well into the low-mid $50s. The ""5"" in that number is a place I don't want to be.  Mercedes 2.0L turbo is smooth, as is the one in the Audi A4.  Still not as silky as say the 6 in the S4, IS 350 or TLX SH AWD, though. Ideally, Acura would slap a urbo on their 3.5L V6.

She's a good driver but I wouldn't trust her 100% with the S4 until she completes a HPDE weekend (which so far I've been unsuccessful in getting her to try). Even with me behind the wheel, someone managed to get into a wreck with the S4 by being just horrible.  I'm not sure the WRX STI would depreciate slower than the S4; especially considering the S4 now has 25,000 miles whereas I'm assuming you meant get a brand new WRX STI. The first 25,000 miles are the biggest.  If I could live with a stick for a daily driver on congested freeways, The STI would be right up my alley. Since I don't want a stick for daily duty, Subaru is out until they develop a good dual clutch auto-manual transmission. At least they don't' embarrass the STi with a CVT option. The Golf R would be a good alternative...., but even if the S4's extra weight keeps it from handling as well, the tuning options on the S4 are quite extraordinary. You can basically turn it into an AWD muscle car that handles reasonably great considering its weight.  The other consideration is the wife is starting to itch for a new vehicle after 8 years with the Civic. Something roomier would be nice since we have a 19-1/2 month old now, and possible wishes for a 2nd in the near future. The Golf SportWagon just surpassed the Forester in the running...

2400,"June 12, 2015  4:35PM",markcincinnati,"I have been told by my rep at The Audi Connection that HP & Torque of ALL the [US] Audi power-plants will increase. We saw, already, the 2016 A6 3.0T adopt the S4 tuning (raised the A6 to 333 HP, just like my A4), and the S6/S7 cranked up the HP or Torque or both, too.  The little engine that could (the 2.0T) has had its power bumped from 200, to 211, to 220 and I believe will be again goosed to 240. Under the four-rings, the torque was always pretty strong at 258 at sub 2,000 RPMs.  And, without breaking a sweat, apparently, Audi really goosed the 4-cylinder to just south of 300HP for the S3, even though there is a lame-o 2.0T (at 200HP and 207lb/ft) in the Q3 (this, I am assured, is temporary, the Q3 will soon come with the beefier 2.0T).  My dealer rep says, too, that ""it just won't do"" for the A6 and the S4 to share the same power rating -- if only for marketing reasons (which is not the case), so the S4 (upcoming) will have more HP and Torque. Of course another reason for the bump in power for the S4 is to make sure that as one aspires to the next Audi up the ladder -- say from S3, to S4, to S6/S7 to S8, etc. -- that the S3 doesn't outgun the S4 (which either it does currently or can, according to the test reports in the big auto magazines). The S6 has to beat the S4, too, in terms of power and measured acceleration times. And so on and so forth. . . .  I would look over a couple year period for the performance envelope to be pushed (upward) by increases, across the lineup, of HP and Torque.  Now, of course, we will have engines other than gas and hybrids and so on -- my assumption is that if the diesel SQ5 were to be offered (in the US) even though it's HP would be down, its torque would be up and through tuning and transmission choices, the ""S"" - ness of the vehicle would not be compromised.  Probably wishful thinking on my part to imagine Audi of America would actually bring the SQ5 in diesel trim to the US.  Look for all of the Europeans, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo and VW to name just a few, to continue the march upward in HP and Torque achieved using 4, 5 and 6 cylinder engines and dropping or reducing the number of and application of V8s, V10s, V12s and W12s.  I have not heard anything about decreasing the power,  Of course, you could be thinking of the smaller displacement engines Audi (among others) offers in markets other than the US. There are smaller (than 2.0T) engines offered by Audi in some of its cars in Europe, for example -- both in gas and diesel configurations.

Both of us wanted to love our Japanese vehicles. There was really nothing wrong with either one of them, but they could not hold us since they lacked that je ne sais quoi that even a stripped Jetta is imbued with.  You can -- and some folks here do -- remark on either the reliability or durability or both sometimes associated with owning a German car. Our experience with German cars has been very positive overall. Yet, we know about the rumors swirling around about the eventual breathtakingly expensive maintenance and repairs that we surely will face if we keep our Germans beyond, 60,000, 70,000 or even more miles.  I can't argue that these dire consequences don't await us, for the highest mileage we've ever kept a German car has been 66K miles -- and that Audi felt ""new"" to me the day I traded it in (on another Audi).  The European cars, most notably the German ones are, somehow, addictive to drive. I would suspect the Japanese cars still haven't cracked the code of how to be a driver's car -- no matter how highly contented or carefree they may ultimately be.  For instance: The Golf R or GTI seem to be quite the bargains, and the car magazines do shower them with many positive comments and pounds of prose extolling their driving virtues. It seems to be that the same is said less often about cars from the other continents.  I do understand, support and agree with everyone's right to choose to drive what Automobile or Car & Driver, et al, magazine would call 'boring cars,' but I do wonder if those who decry my critical comments about said 'boring cars' have actually spent much time behind the wheel of one of the German cars (from Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Porsche) so often fawned over by enthusiast magazine journalists? If I have misread this, I apologize without further ado.  You may love your fill-in-the-blank and think my [admittedly] biased perspectives elitist or even ignorant, and that is fine with me -- I leave this post, however, once again urging you to test drive, test drive, test drive and keep test driving as many cars as possible. Makes the weekends very interesting, that much is certain.  A friend of mine always ends up buying/leasing KIA's and/or Mazda's all the while waxing darn near poetic on the virtues of Audis, BMWs, Mercedes, Porsches and even a few of VW's offerings. He always wants to ""test"" my cars -- and then ultimately goes for the KIA Optima or the Mazda 3 or 6 citing that he is ""too frugal"" to go for the ""superior sports sedan""-- electing to go for the Optima which he says is better than they used to be in the suspension department and since they poached the car's designer from Audi AG, well, ""the KIA Optima is great looking too.""  I can't find fault with him for wanting to be frugal -- I really don't find fault at all with his designation of what to spend his money on, of course. I do find myself confused -- I would think he (or anyone who seems to say one thing and do another) must suffer from chronic cognitive dissonance, however.

Perhaps in addition to being confused by my friend's decision to go with the thing he thinks is inferior to the BMW (or whatever) he really wants, I am made somewhat sad that he -- a very close friend -- seems to have such passion for something that is not the thing he will go ahead and spend on.  There is always somewhat of a tone, a lament, as he apparently rationalizes not going for the ""thing"" about which he waxes oh so poetic and is also very knowledgeable about. He cites chapter and verse the performance stats and specifications of this, that and the other Porsche or BMW, etc, then apologizes for the KIA. This is a very successful and well educated guy. Perhaps it is that this behavior seems out of character.  He has no need to apologize -- to me at least -- for his decision. Our friendship is not based upon his possessions -- and there is no way he could think that the case. Had I the means and a spouse who would permit, I'd get him an M3 or 5 series for pity's sake and hopefully enjoy -- vicariously -- him drive it.

Now, in the course of 700 miles, assuming I have no reliability issues, my perception of the greatness of the car will probably remain unchanged.  VW should be ashamed of itself if the reliability and dealer experience isn't corrected sooner rather than later.  Speaking of perspectives, I also enjoyed our Infiniti -- kept it 39 months, and other than a new set of tires, the thing was as close to flawless (in terms of the driving experience, reliability and durability) as one would expect. I did test the Q50S, the Lexus 350 F-Sport (and even ordered one) -- so I can understand and support several non-German cars as great. My specific rant pertaining to Toyotas was just that, remarks pertaining to Toyota, not all non-German cars.  I do test drive a lot of cars, and I rent a lot of cars -- the rental experiences typically allow me to drive hundreds of miles in a given example. The Toyotas typically and specifically are a huge disappointment -- which confuses me considering their apparent sales successes. Hondas, to name another Asian brand, on the other hand, do not suffer from this good enough approach. The Hyundai Genesis, and Kia Optoma too are examples of cars that certain seem to not be satisfied with a good enough approach.  A few days ago when I started this ""I'm disappointed in"" Toyota thread, I did only mention Toyota and that still stands. The phrase, ""I hate Toyotas"" is simply my way, in this forum of supporting the notion that good is the enemy of great.  The good news is, it certainly seems that a lot of folks are participating and voicing their opinions on this and other subjects, which, from my perspective is a good thing, what this ""tool"" (the Edmunds forum) is all about.",remarks perspectives driving rant correct unchanged specific participating hate perspective phrase safety started youre im waning issues typically rather disappointed several taking stands specifically accurate great huge name folks 700 experiences dealer regarding cite forum simply rental brand reasons sales seem sooner supporting months news considering suck pertaining still jeaudia hand kept certainly another disappointment shame support examples lexus audi test kia close mention even rent drive good terms new liked set toyota german approach confuses voicing yet greatness comparing allow honda performance often understand ordered opinions suffer hyundai notion favorably perception remain 350 since solid 39 nongerman popularity steering would asian speaking optoma seems enjoyed isnt ashamed subjects durability example days edmunds certain later course way probably cars communicative enemy infiniti tool miles assertions ago lot successes acura satisfied andor performance experience hundreds one like corrected thread assuming also thing fperformance apparent expect enough car given flawless volkswagen audi0s apparenacuray

I am one of the owners of the company and the CEO. The CTO of the company and I were going to make a two-hour presentation and move the needle toward ""buy."" When we travel for marketing reasons we figure any flight takes about 4 hours all in. Chicago, drive. Cleveland, drive. New York, fly. Nashville @ 3:45, drive (and besides the cost of 2 round trip tickets was over $2K). We pay $.55 per mile for using ""your"" personal car. The rental plus gas for this trip was about $150, hotel another $240 (we stayed at the ""Maxwell House""). At over 600 miles total, there would have been a significant cost increase in using a personal vehicle.  What kind of example would it set if I used a personal car and charged the company @$.55 per mile x 600+ miles? The next trip to, er, Pittsburgh where I am not going would cost what?

Now, were I to return to Nashville for a pleasure trip (and Nashville is worthy of such a trip if you axed me), I would take either the S4 or the SQ5.

My point and question is why not build a great car at every price point. I do think the Toyota is probably a good car -- and, as someone says (not just someone but Voltaire, born in 1694) -- ""good is the enemy of great.""  I would agree with something here -- ""95% of the buying public has no . . . need for an ELLPS."" Their interest level is harder to ascertain, but, assuming you are correct that 95% have no interest, I would be made both sad and fearful. I assume you assume they -- the 95% -- have no interest because . . .um, they have never been exposed to greatness (at THAT particular price point)?  Let me give you an irrelevant comparison -- while growing up, my mother fixed this nasty-tasting ""entree"" she called salmon patties. They looked like a cross between a hamburger and what, today, I think of as a mostly-crab, crab-cake. The taste, after frying was, well, horrible. But, hey, it's Friday so well it was either fried smelt or salmon patties; so after a while I actually ate the salmon patties entirely. I don't think I ever liked them, but I did learn to tolerate them. Eventually, in a sentimental, not logical or rational, moment I was told I actually said (I deny this) ""salmon patties are good."" Perhaps, salmon patties are good compared to, er, hmm, DIRT!  Time and tide, time and tide -- and I eat (in college) at a nice restaurant and the special of the day is salmon. First off, when it comes, I barely recognize it, and then when I taste it, I know for sure ""this sure as hell isn't salmon!"" Salmon is great, I love salmon -- I had grown to accept canned salmon [allegedly] as good.  How much is an Avalon or a Camry? Don't answer that, the point is not how much it costs it's that for THAT much money, it ought to be possible to build a great car, not just a good one that has a lot of stuff for the money. Now, if the stuff is what actually makes it great -- and NOT the driving experience or its capabilities -- well, then I don't know what we're all talking about here. We COULD add navigation and blu-tooth to a Trabant I would assume, but that wouldn't make it even a good car, it would still be a bad car that just happen to have sat-nav.  I don't think everyone needs or wants or should need or want an ELLPS -- I do think we all deserve to know what real salmon tastes like, so to speak.

Do we now tell our children, their teachers, our leaders, etc, that it is ""OK"" to not go for great?  How could it belittle anyone to urge them to strive for ""the best"" (at every price point) -- I've not suggested that the customer who shops for a Chevy is any less entitled to the best (at that price point) than is the Rolls buyer (at that price point).  Everything made and done is not great -- I assume we all would agree to that. I am hoping to spark the conversation to perhaps contemplate that we simply shouldn't settle for good enough no matter how much or little we pay.  I just think that good enough or good has begat an erosion of what we'll accept -- hence the term dumbing-down. We, at times, seem complacent -- we accept good enough, we don't ""demand"" great.

You can get previous standard seats on 328/340 by getting premium package and luxury line (which is no cost) To get M-sport suspension (2VF adaptive or 704 regular), you need M-sport package or track package. However, they did say they have ""newly tuned"" the suspension and steering. If that delivers, it may be OK in standard form.  They still had to monkey with option configurations - up to now, whole ""Line"" thing was a mess. Can get this, but not that, etc. It's simplified and more available, BUT now you will be able get black with red stitching (which I love) only with regular suspension. ""Sporty red stitching"", which was the hallmark of the Sport Line is mutually exclusive with sport suspension elements, because it's not available with those M-sport packages. This is nuts.  They increased the price for 340, but the equipment offsets are more than sufficient, so overall value is better than current year. Actually, it's much better. However, there are also couple of slight of hands on 328 to make you believe you get more, but you don't. Premium package no longer has leather, but its price for 328 stays close to this year, because they swapped it for LED lights. 340 has all premium pack equipment standard, so that is not an issue. Leather is no a stand alone handsome $1450 option. I predict it will result in much more fake stuff showing in the dealers' inventories than this year. Now you could get leather as stand alone or as premium package, which was a frequent option. Once it's remove, it will probably be going to be first thing to go, for price conscious customers and ordering managers. BMW went essentially Mercedes way. I hate that.  So if you want 335, you better wait for 340, because it's going to be a better deal overall (unless you get some awesome discount to offset that difference). However, for 328 I see not much value added, just more shuffling to make you believe you're getting more. Good example is that leather vs. LED in premium package.

In the ELLPS class, often the tires are of the low profile, super sticky and stiff sidewall type which ""normally"" translates to relatively short tread wear. If you lease a German car, these days, it often comes with MAX performance summer only tires and those types have even less tread life since they offer very soft tread in the pursuit of high cornering forces.  SW Ohio leases are typically 36 to 39 months and 15K per year. No way you could keep the OEM tires on the car, at least if you wanted to enjoy the last 6 to 12 months of ""ownership.""

The reason why GM was failing was the bean counter ran the company, it was cheaper to build one platform and have all brands use it, Caddy was dying because the generation who bought them where dying and people who had the money didn't want a front wheel drive Caddy that didn't drive well. That is why GM imported a Opal that could zig.

2567,"May 26, 2015  3:58AM",markcincinnati,"The way I earn my living is by working with distributors of beverage alcohol products. For purposes of our discussions here, think of these distributors as your friendly local auto dealers.  I have come to learn that the distributors and suppliers have a love hate relationship. I must assume there is some similarity with auto mfgs and their retailers. Since I have been dealing with German car dealerships for the most part since 1977, my observation does not support this assumption. My Audi dealer seems to have a very positive relationship with Audi of America. My beverage alcohol customers seem to have no love lost relationship with their suppliers, however.  So, I do believe that my only matter of recourse, should I have an issue with my German car, is by dealing with my Audi dealer (at least first off). I have no issues with my dealership and we also had no issues with our three BMW's and the local BMW dealership. When something needed attending, the Audi and BMW dealership have always greased the skids, so to speak, to get the issue taken care of.  My few dalliances with American cars have, on the other hand, almost always had issues that the dealer wanted to get argumentative with. The same was true with Acura, but not with Infiniti. If someone says they have had issues with a GM or Chrysler car that required ""much"" effort to achieve resolution, well that seems, to me, to be justification for not patronizing American car dealerships. I've had the same experiences way back when I was in college and was trying to become a life-long Chrysler products customer.  My somewhat recent experience visiting a Chrysler/Jeep dealership in search of a new car, really did but one thing: I would, at this juncture, NEVER buy a Chrysler/Jeep product, as the experience made me feel the need for a shower -- and that was just going in for a test drive.  My preference is to work with what I have come to call ""horizontal"" car dealerships. The salespeople at such dealerships seem hell bent on discussing everything BUT the cars they presumably sell. Talk about zero pressure, zero stress, the German car reps seem, on a scale of 1 to 10 to place selling a car as number 11 on their list of things they want to do. One being the #1 thing they want to do.  Of course, the cynic in me assumes this could be part of a well studied act to make me believe they [the German dealership] really do care about what I want, rather than making a sale TODAY. In any case, I do respond to the negative pressure to buy. And, truth be told, I am not really all that concerned if this is all just contrived to manipulate me.  The guy I buy cars from is on my ""list"": you know the one that has a doctor, dentist, barber, accountant, lawyer, vet and a few other key individuals on it that we all rely on to keep us safe, sane, legal and well.  In my case, I happen to love German cars, Swiss watches, Italian shoes, and mostly Japanese electronics, and so on -- I have come to build relationships with folks who sell and support these products and services.  Nothing is perfect -- and I assume every product has lemons -- and because of this, I believe in relationships. If you buy into the notion that the stuff we buy we buy because of the service and support afforded us as consumers by the retailers, you should be shopping for the purveyor with as much care as you shop for the product itself.  My experiences -- after 33 Audis all from the same dealership -- have convinced me nothing else even comes close.

Most of us have to make choices -- a new fill-in-the blank appliance, car, house, sofa, TV and so on. More important than ""things"" are the other choices we make -- perhaps it is children, college funds (for your kids or for your MBA or JD or whatever). The thing is very few of us can ""have it all."" And, even some who literally could have it all, don't want it all. My best friend worked hard at a manufacturing company and eventually became the president of the company -- he never, in his entire life, has owned a new car. He searches -- it seems like all the time, to me -- for the ""cherry"" car. He finds the mythical little old lady or little old man who has a 2005 Cadillac with 15,000 original miles on it and that's what he goes for. He is as passionate about cars -- subscribes to ALL of the magazines -- as I am. This guy knows chapter and verse specs about new cars, yet is always driving a car over 5 years old.  His ""settling"" on these rare cream puff cars allows him to spend lots of time on the west coast of Florida on a houseboat, sailing, fishing and sitting in the sun drinking a cold beer.  Whenever I get a new car, I take it to him and we go out for a long test drive -- with him behind the wheel. I can tell he loves the car and probably he hopes that when I get rid of it, he can be the next owner.  My wife and I work (long hours, typically), enjoy fine dining, wine, European travel and ELLPS cars. We probably could afford (that is the deal could be done) for an Audi RS7 ($120,000 MSRP). We'd have to settle on other things were we to go for the RS.  Instead we decided to set our sites on far less expensive cars (mine was $57K, hers $65K), we bought hers and leased mine. The burden for both is $1,400 per month, all in.  Our next door neighbor has a new 750 BMW -- and a Camry -- the Bimmer costs as much as both of our cars combined. The guy across the street has a Hyundai and a Yukon but also owns 1/5th of an airplane. We're all settling in our own ways. Cars are, for me, slowly, very slowly, beginning to be less important to me at 63 than they were when I was 50.

2636,"May  5, 2015  7:13PM",markcincinnati,"Someone here wrote that the German practice of a new model designation (with Audi it is B, C, D, etc) is to release a new model every 8 years with a ""refresh"" at year 5 or 6. This is a practice that, I assume, comes from the desire to amortize development costs (and, in theory, lower the MSRPs) over a long time horizon.  The issue is, car magazines (and the market itself) can latch onto the descriptor: ""Long in the tooth."" I have a 2014 A4 (B8) sub designated S4. I had a 2009 A4 2.0T Prestige that I took delivery of in 2008. A NEW 2015 A4/S4 is essentially the same as a 2008 available A4. There is, far as I know, no new ordering guide for 2016 A4's available yet.  But, this is the time of year, typically, that you can order a NEW A4 and what will arrive is the NEXT MY. Far as I know -- the operative phrase -- if you go into an Audi dealer and order up a new S4 Prestige with a bunch of options on it, what will arrive is a 2015 B8 version, not the eagerly anticipated B9 morphed model.  At the rate of change that is POSSIBLE, it would seem to me that an 8 year model to model cycle may now be too long. No wonder the A4 is selling poorly -- at this price point, folks want THE NEXT, not THE CURRENT, especially if the CURRENT is, literally, 8 years old, no matter how effective the mid-cycle refresh has been.  Now, I have had my 2014 about a year and a half. I have 25K miles on it. I love this car. I am thinking about replacing the tires thus enjoying the car for the next 35K miles with improved shoes.  I am hoping on a major evolution in the A4 model line as it goes from B8 to B9, and I guess the thing to do is to get the NEW version within the first 2 or 3 MY's into the -- apparent -- 8 year cycle.  I assume my current S4's durability is not in question -- thus far it has been bullet proof. I will be having the car ""rejuvinated"" at a local detail shop next week. I an assuming this process will do what the name suggests. And, I am looking forward to keeping the car beyond the end of its lease term.  Subsequently, I plan -- plans are nothing, planning is everything -- to buy the next time out, but who knows, things may change. Yet, I still assume I will have to order the car to my specs, but there's the fun, it's like getting a new car TWICE within 90 days.  And, BTW, someone wrote that cars on the lot are less expensive than ordered cars -- I guess there are exceptions to every ""rule"" -- but in my experience an ordered car is typically hundreds less than a car on the lot; and I've never had a dealer or dealer sales rep indicate anything other than a great willingness to take an order. My rep says he would be fine -- financially, I assume -- if everyone ordered and used the dealership for test drives; this way, he says, he could have more variety available for prospects to test drive.

2640,"May  6, 2015  3:43AM",markcincinnati,"I have nothing against Hondas -- I did have an Acura TL SH-AWD for a time and thought it the Japanese S4 alternative.  Honda sells an incredible number of units per year -- they offer, apparently, a large number of customers and prospective customers what they want or what they are willing to settle for. That last declaration can be applied to Hondas and Acuras, VW's and Audis and Nissans and Infinitis and Toyotas and Lexus cars.  To some extent, we all settle.  My opinion, and it is a ""data point"" opinion, is that folks who go for Hondas instead of Acuras, etc, etc, settle more, probably, because they just aren't into cars that much. I work with folks who lease new Corollas every 24 months -- they proclaim in word and deed that their 8 mile per day round trip drive isn't worth getting a Lexus IS350 F-Sport AWD. They see no merit in cars, hoping instead for public transportation that would eliminate their ""need"" for a car altogether/ Across the hall is another ""cars are a necessary evil"" individual who is happy to buy a well worn but reliable mini-van opting instead for a new fridge, dishwasher, range and washer and dryer. We also have an empty nester two high income couple who love Acuras. The last player in our small group loves Minis and is as passionate about the brand as I am about Audis.  It takes all kinds.  I would not, on purpose, go to Honda for a new car -- I did dip my toe into Honda in 2012. The Accord line is nice -- but personally, I found it bland, uninvolving but well built with a smooth power train.  I am 63, at this point in my life I find myself repeating ""life's too short"" whenever I consider any purchase over some at the time appropriate sum.  Every appliance we have purchased -- if we settled too much -- fails quickly, either literally or in its utilitarian aspect. We bought three Whirlpool dishwashers (top of the line) and the damn things kept breaking (thankfully in their warranty period), then when they broke again out of warranty, the repair costs were often about 2/3rds the cost of a new dishwasher. Dishwasher number four was a Bosch -- the thing is a tank and is so quiet its damn near impossible to know if it is running or not.  The point is settle on the things that are not important to you, settle less and less on things that are important to you. If you are ""into"" (whatever that means to you) cars, you'll probably be compelled toward the ELLPS and LPS models many of us go on about here. If you'd rather have a new Viking range and a new Sub-zero fridge and so on, and aren't made of money, well your choice is much more clear -- go for the great stuff in the kitchen and the good stuff in the garage. I have no quarrel with that.  If you want a larger portfolio and are willing to drive something less than an LPS car, go for that.  Settle on the things you don't care about and don't settle on the things you do.  This is not the entire extent of what I have learned in 63 years, but it did, at the time (way back when) come to feel like an epiphany.  That is why I say: Drive it like you live..  So far, I do not have to settle on a Honda or a Toyota -- but it doesn't mean if you do that I don't respect your decision (unless you are ""over-settling"" -- you'll easily recognize this if you constantly complain about your new car or whatever).",round point japanese deed word appliance impossible damn incredible takes sells minivan smooth dont broke viking worn costs consider either infinitis short happy rather epiphany say opinion train feel near brands ensafety work passionate worth utilitarian care folks great every opting nissan across larger running day public minis bought high recognize brand acuras merit arent fails 2012 lps money thought see back months 8 geaudiing easily know sperformanceerformance much console life whenever kept maintenance many stuff portfolio doesnt respect another need range cost evil purpose line made small dishwashers couple large data lexus performance audi purchased literally applied nice trip tranperformanceation 24 prospective drive offer dryer personally alternative hall last new love kitchen good willing toyota thankfully customers washer uninvolving lease purchase setacurae want eliminate far repeating toward less two aspect learned mean come mile period appropriate years honda top often us quiet instead four whatever oversetacuraing sum three well year extent decision time volkswagens would per constanacuray promercedesim built altogether isnt things toe iaudi50 dip setacuraed necessary 23rds way live probably dishwasher performance cars buy quarrel etc group bland tank hoping performance numercedeser find found garage important complain units subzero income lifes breaking go empty nothing acura something nester kinds individual youd choice clear like unless fridge fperformance also thing compelled youll car maintenance means quickly whirlpool demercedesration bosch loves ellps 63 apparenacuray

2642,"May  6, 2015  3:23PM",graphicguy,"I live near a Mercedes dealer in the county just north of the Greater Cincinnati area. As such, I receive mailings all the time from the dealer, given they captured my contact info when I was helping my sister buy a C class several months ago.  Knowing that the ""NEW"" C Class was on its way, I told her to hold on for 6-8 months to look at the ""all new"" 2015 C. But, everyone knew the new C was just around the corner, so the dealers and Mercedes were really aggressive pricewise in selling the '14s.  Anyway, got an email from one of the new sales people at the local Mercedes dealer that was obviously culled from my company's database showing what I'm sure is the only person who works for my company within a 250 mile area (probably bigger). They were having some private showing of a GTS. I ended up on the list to attend a ""look see"".  Clearly, they didn't have access to my salary info if they thought I was a target customer for the AMG GT-S. But, I had heard about it, read about it, thought it was ""cool"" so yeah....I'll eat free canapes if they let me sit in it. IF they let me drive it....even better.  I'll cut to the chase. They didn't let me drive it. Got to sit in it, though. I hate the new ""flat"" paint jobs these cars have. But, I guess the very high end cars are all getting them, Mercedes AMG is no exception.  Can't really see paying as much for a car as a starter home costs, but if you have the disposable income to do so, you'd probably be hard pressed to find a nicer car.  As I wandered from the hoard who was engulfing shrimp cocktail and pate, I spied a humble C-Class outside. Steel Grey with Red Leather (the real stuff....not the fake stuff Mercedes tries to tell you is ""better than leather"" (it's not). This wasn't the 400, but the lowly 300 with a turbo 4 cyl. Sales guy spots me, asks me what I thought. Told him I liked the color combo better than any I'd seen so far.  At the Autu Show this past winter, they were showing one that was black on black without the sport package....pretty dour. This one, was quite different. Very pretty. Sales guy has keys and a dealer tag before I knew he had left. ""Go for a spin?"".  ""I'm not in the market"".  Sales-""I'd rather take you for a test drive and hope you remember me when you are in the market.""  ""Fair enough"".  It's taken me awhile, but I've finally wrapped my head around sports sedans with 4 cyl. Actually, these turbo motors really do amaze me. They're torquey. More fuel efficient. Lighter. And generally, they may not be faster, but just more fun to drive than the recent 6 cyl cars I've had recently. Truth told, they're pretty damned quick in their own right.  This one is no different. I don't know the specs, but it's typical. No turbo lag that I could ascertain. Quick off the line. Pulled hard over a broad RPM range. It was quieter than the growl my CTS gives off (which I like). 7 speed trans that you have to goad a bit to downshift, but steering wheel paddles help with this. It's smoother than my CTS trans, but I've got one less gear and my trans is already pretty smooth already (GM KNOWS how to make a good automatic trans).  C Seats I really liked...even better than my ""go to"" sport seats in the TL SH AWD. The Benz felt tailored to me. I think most of that is due to the very soft leather (again, no hard ""pleather"") and the crazy amount of adjustments you can make to them....including power thigh extenders.  My CTS seems faster, but again, the C is no slouch. CTS suspension is geared more towards handling. C is geared more towards ride, but certainly could hold its own. At least that's the first impression over what was a 20 minute test drive.  Now, my CTS interior is no slouch in the build and materials category. Real wood, leather, suede, aluminum, is well put together, inside and out...probably the best GM has ever done with any car they've built........EVER!  C Class is over the top, especially at the price point. Again, real leather, aluminum and the switches were the same as I just had seen in the AMG just 30 minutes earlier. They felt the same, too. Mercedes leather is better than Cadillac leather, which is really good in and of itself. Porous wood, is better than CTS polished wood (which again, is really, really good).  I didn't like the new trend of the ""screen as an afterthought"". Cadillac does a much better job. I don't like the trans ""stalk"", but understand that's a Mercedes trade mark (really?). My CTS is bigger, but hte C felt more comfortable.  Final thoughts. The C stickered for right around $50K. Their discount, my corporate discount, probably put it somewhere in the $44K-$45K range. At that price? A very compelling car. The interior is what would sell it. It's competitive everywhere else...drive, handling, performance...with the 3, A, etc. ATS is edgier (as is my CTS).  Maintenance? Included with Cadillac for 4 years. Way cheaper than Mercedes after warranty period, too.

2651,"May  7, 2015  1:07PM",graphicguy," Mark.....all good points.  I was just having this conversation with my best friend. He has a $70K '15 Corvette, that for the most part, sits in his garage gathering dust. He drives a new Suburban every 2 years....I'll assume those are at least in the $50K range with discounts...probably closer to $65K with the new version. His wife drives an Infiniti M something....assume mid $50s on that. So, in short, he has roughly $185K tied up in vehicles,,,,,,,RIGHT THIS MOMENT.  He's in my tax bracket. Not Soros money, nor even failed Silicon Valley start up money. But, enough that we're not too worried about going into a dealership and buying something like a brand new Corvette as an impulse buy.  His philosophy? Spend it all while alive and healthy. He has no kids. He was an only child. So, outside of his wife, he really has no other outlet to spend his money (or even save for college tuition, teen insurance rates, etc). In short, the only thing he has to worry about is staying relatively healthy.  Some worry and sweat every purchase, whether it's that new leather recliner, or whether to buy a Honda or an Acura. They have kids. They have huge tuition bills staring at them. I get that. I've been there.  I'm 10 years before I think about retirement. So, that's something I think about, but certainly doesn't occupy a lot of my time. I think I'm good, but who knows what will happen over the next decade.  Would it make a major financial lifestyle change if I bought a Z06 Corvette? Nope. The only question I'd ask myself is ""what else could you do with that money?""  I see my son, who has a good job in IT. He works for a major University, so his job is secure, probably as long as he wants to stay there. He's wanting a new WRX. He's fretting over how it will affect his lifestyle currently. As I told him, budget it up. If it would get in the way of your savings plan as it stands right now (I actually showed him how to budget for just about everything and anything), then don't do it. If you can do all the things you're doing now, put all the eggs in the baskets you've set up. then go for it.  Who I feel for are the folks who are busting their tails to make ends meet. Their budget is sliced so thin, that tomorrow is only a hope that they've got enough to feed their family healthily. If their 10 year old Caravan has a major issue, it will mean a large change in a lifestyle that can ill afford any negative changes and is begging for anything positive. They can't afford a new car (although dealers would love to get them in and finance them at their high rates). They're the ones who need a new car the most.  On the other end of that spectrum, there's my other colleague, who has a 12 year old TL....250K miles. We both get a healthy car allowance....BUT...only if the car is 3 years old or less and is on their ""list"" of approved vehicles. He bought the TL used a decade ago and is having fits about how much ""cars cost"" today. If he could drive a used Tercel and pocket the car allowance, he'd be happy. And yes, he can afford any car he wanted....including those $100K cars you speak about.  I fall in the middle. I like the nicer cars. but have my own definitions on what I'll spend money on. I like nice cars, but not ones that cost $60K (unless that $60K car was an overwhelming value at that price). I'll put a limit set at $55K. I've long given up the notion of any car as something that's anything more than an expense to me. It's a depreciating asset. Truthfully, it's not even an asset in my mind.

2692,"April 28, 2015  4:39PM",markcincinnati," I did not say a ""million per year"" -- but that technicality was not really the point. The spirit of what I was saying was simply that cars, like houses, are very expensive purchases, yet we seem (to me, and I am only speaking for me) to buy these expensive durable goods with (what I perceive) not much discriminating thought put into the expenditure.  But, perhaps the system is set up that way -- folks go to the auto dealership thinking they want a dark blue metallic car with an ecru interior but, for the sake of -- what? -- expediency end up with gloss black paint and a light gray interior.  All I am saying (about myself) is I grew up in the 1960's when a brand new Chrysler Newport was under $4,000 -- which, for my parents, was a HUGE purchase. Since it (the 1963 Chrysler Newport) was my parent's first new car ever, they wanted (god knows why) seafoam metallic (a kind of medium green with a shiny tinge to it), automatic transmission, an AM radio with a rear seat speaker, a rear window defroster and power steering and power brakes. My parents thought (I assume) since they were ""spending a young fortune"" they should get exactly what they wanted, not necessarily just what was on the lot.  That mode of thinking stuck with me. Me -- not you, not other 'mericans, apparently.  My way is not correct for anyone else but me (but it might be, for all I know) -- it is, however, not incorrect.  Considering it would be less expensive if we ordered cars and considering that ordering a new car is almost the only way to get exactly the car you want, I simply struggle with the notion of ""test drive and buy today."" Clearly cars are bought in less than logical or even financially advantageous ways. Makes some sense, though, since cars are very emotional ""things"" -- or, better said, ""cars make US, emotional and irrational.""

Now, remember I said we -- broadly speaking -- don't test drive cars/SUV's that we are pretty certain we would NEVER buy. For instance, much as I might be entertained by driving a Corvette, I know in my heart of hearts I'd never buy one (even with your money). I just don't bother test driving them, therefore.  I have test driven an X6 -- and NOW, I know I wouldn't buy one, but at the time, it did seem like it was possible. Also test drove an Acura ZDX, for the money, it was better than the X6, but, for the money, I'd go with an MDX and pocket the $10,000. Likewise, I just CAN'T justify an Audi A7 or S7 when, since I have driven both, there is an A6 and S6 that are as far as I am concerned identical. Now, I do like the looks of an A7, but not $10,000 more than I like an A6, and so on.  I tested a couple of Jeeps (even the SRT 8 version) whilst we were shopping for the SQ5.  I can't see myself testing a Malibu -- just not interested, nothing against the car, per se, just not for me.  Same with a KIA Soul (is that spelled correctly?) -- but I would try (and have) an Optoma and am interested in a Genesis as a possible old-fart's alternative to an A6 for when I am 73, not 63, perhaps. And so forth.  I don't want to waste the dealer's time nor my time -- but test driving is both good education and good fun (or at least it can be both).  I'll not be testing a VW bug anytime soon, but I have tested the Toureg (and the Cayenne) and the Q7, too -- a VW CC sure is purty and in AWD trim could be #11 on my top 10, so to speak.  Within reason -- REASON -- I would think dealers need as many folks of means testing their cars as they can get their hands on. My wife and I test drove an Acadia a number of times -- came moderately close to moving on it, instead went with a 2011 FX35 (Infiniti).

The owner is paying for bunch of iron on their lot so this future order (that may be canceled) is not paying off any existing unit yet, but if you had bought today one out of those on the lot, the bank gets the check and interest stops. The system is absolutely geared toward here and now and the players adjusted to it. The benefit is lower prices, the drawback - limited selection and reliance on guesses from dealers' and regional reps' what will sell in what proportions. They essentially already decided for us what we want.  The German brand salespeople are usually well trained to accept orders and act like they're happy about it (even if they preferred to sell us something from the lot). Moreover, they generally have a system where every car has an order behind it (it usually is a sales manages, sometimes actual customer). They even have some ""special order"" options (like colors) that require actual end customer for production (managers sometimes create a virtual Joe Smith to work the system).  Try make an order at a Honda dealer - you get rolling eyes, laugh, dismissal, or even anger. Not to mention that Honda itself simply doesn't build ordered cars - it builds whatever it thinks will sell and then MAYBE you get lucky when one of those cars will be what you ordered. There is some chance, as they generally limit possible combinations.  BTW, those who make argument that order should be cheaper because it doesn't cost as much (no financing), it's true only in theory. In aggregate, all cars pay for the financing, including those that did not bear that direct cost. Also, if that logic was correct, a ""lot queen"" sitting there for months should have a premium sticker slapped onto it to cover that interest - but it's quite the opposite, isn't it?

Since sunroofs are only ""standard"" in some markets, I have to assume that the decision to include a sunroof in the US is the fact that we Americans want sunroofs and EXPECT them and perhaps would not like seeing a sunroof (which is a right, after all) with a line item with a charge on it on the window sticker.

Configured two cars as close to identical as the web site configurators would allow; the BMW's MSRP rose more quickly than the Audi's, even though they seem to be comparable when ""stripped"" (which is due to the fact that the Audi has more content than the BMW in base form). Then the BMW surges past the Audi when the option boxes are checked off in an attempt to keep the cars as close as possible in terms of their equipment levels.  I don't know if anything was actually proven, but her friend ended up with a 2016 A6 3.0T Sline Prestige for about the same price as a 4-cylinder BMW 5 series with a couple fewer options. The BMW seemed to shoot up in price as the attempt to content it like the Prestige package moved forward.  But this may be an example that isn't typical -- maybe the BMW is comparable assuming you don't put ventilated seats, heads up display, sport package and LED headlights on it -- I find the configurators take a lot of work to pull together comparable equipment levels (and maybe that's the point.)  I tried doing this with a Porsche Macaan vs an Audi SQ5 -- the Porsche dealer said the differences in price for content were very small. My calculations came up with about a $15,000 difference. Maybe that is what Porsche figures is a small difference.  Hell, at these price points, price isn't really the main selling factor -- after all, if what we wanted was a lot of bang for our bucks, we'd all buy KIA's, yes?",driving point fewer somehow configured content ive market rose performance dont optional wife ended comfort gray include bucks proven moved item difference possible styling brands take efficiency work wiped secadillac keep americans forward display surges dealer site markets came credit past noted bought fan simply main increase equipment suggest form aaudiempt bang typical europe due seem really levels msrp yes 5000cs prestige making heads know boxes led damp base cost shoot instance assume line went standard seeing couple small bundling maybe purchased audi test close differences must competing kia stripped default scale even bmw higher regular stylings terms right liked configurators friend anything selling 30t together vs wed company want arm comparable two identical 15000 pull allow 4performance said ventilated wanted may macaan though us sticker wonder hell glove since 5 decision spec time saudi perhaps would get tried price checked owned series isnt 2016 options calculations example styling seen actually way cars buy fact package change find miles option ago porsche points sline lot profits previously put pearl delete factor wool like box web assuming expect car charge figures stylings particular window thcadillac quickly seemed cloth

2733,"April 28, 2015  1:15PM",markcincinnati," According to my dealer rep, you can delete the sunroof on ordered vehicles. The thing is, however, the thought is you must pay to play when you order a car either in an unpopular color or with options deleted that will make the car, er, ""unmarketable.""  Increasingly, even the German cars are only purchased ""off the lot"" -- as we Americans seem to want immediate gratification -- so cars are ordered that the dealer feels confident will sell within some reasonable time frame, thus not incurring interest charges that are above the planned amount.  The off the lot mentality, too, is why so many cars in stock are black, gray, silver with black interiors, etc. We've apparently decided that we want our cars with black paint and black leather -- it is very difficult to find cars with more imaginative color combinations, or without certain packages.  I don't fault the dealers, though, car buying is: test drive and buy on Saturday and, if possible, drive it home on Saturday.  My wife's friend bought a very nice new car, about $70K before discount. A long Saturday test drive, followed by an offer, followed by a pick up on Monday. Wham bam, thank you m'am.  Now, the car in question looked like the Batmobile (well, sort of) and it is a very very nice ride. But, this method of picking out a $70K car seems like settling. I guess it is possible the car was configured EXACTLY as wanted, so ordering it was unnecessary.  But, why not take the time to ""build"" the car just like many of us build the houses we live in, the suits we wear, etc; and, then wait for the thing to be fabricated to your specifications?  Clearly, there is something wrong with me.  I am thinking that I purchased ONE new Audi off the lot and purchased one ""previously owned"" Audi (essentially off the lot, too) out of 32 of them. I kept the new one I bought off the lot for less than 12 months because it wasn't equipped to my liking. See, something's just not right with me.  The last time I was in Germany was 2005 -- at that time, the Audi dealer in Munich I spoke with said they keep no inventory other than cars for test drives because ""everyone"" orders their cars. Well, sure, I thought, you're in Munich -- but the same thing is true in Zurich. Folks decide to buy a car, work with a dealer rep to order the car, wait 4-6 weeks and pick it up -- getting EXACTLY the car they wanted. Is this still European practice?

2736,"April 28, 2015  2:05PM",dino001," Bingo. There is something in current American culture that prevents people from waiting for anything. That was not how the country was founded, but it is, how it evolved. Instant gratification is so entrenched that people would rather get a different color, no sunroof, or ugly (in their opinion) wheels rather than wait for what they actually want. One would think that products of such high value would be carefully selected and purchased to the specification of the customer, but the waiting seems almost ""unamerican"". I literally had to deal with blank stares and puzzled looks from all involved, from sales people, to coworkers, when I said I (want to or) ordered my car and it will come in couple of months. ""Why would you wait?"", they asked.  I think there is a strong feedback loop in this - people want an instant gratifications, so the dealers and manufacturers adjusted to that world view by taking large inventories of product (nowhere else in the world car dealers have such enormous inventory) - which in turn conditions them to attempt to push for sales of what they already have (financing cost of the inventory) rather some future product that may even get canceled. Sale can be really booked when when the product and funds changes hands, not when order is made and just a small deposit is made. The finality of spot delivery gives a lot of incentives to everybody involved to accept what is there, rather than what may be there. This of course creates sales people with blank stares and puzzled looks when they meet a ""pickey"" cutomer (like me), who wants an exact color, style and options and is willing to wait for it. Customers know that, too and they know their power of instant gratification works the other way, as well as their own. Unit taken off the lot today, is one with no more financing cost.  I always read that an ordered car should be less expensive than one from the lot, because it's not financed. This is true in theory, but the psychology works in exactly opposite direction. The sales people act like they're making you a favor by accepting a future order rather than taking the car from the lot (and for reasons stated above, they may even believe that), which means you should pay for that ""favor"". If you were more ""accommodating"" to their immediate needs (take one unit from the lot), they may be more ""accommodating"", too. As a result, some people who would be willing to wait hear they could get extra $1000 off the car on the lot (even if it doesn't make any sense from cost-plus point of view), so they adjust their expectation and take one with a different color or wrong options, just so they can believe they got a better deal. It even works for them long term, as such a customer, who bought a ""deal"" may be more willing to accelerate next purchase, as they may never get over that color, or those wrong options.  That's how the feedback loop closes - since people are willing to accept ""imperfect"" product, why change the business model that ""works""?",never point people think stares inventories costplus term accept deposit sense product rather future loop opinion taking could long asked take cutomer extra almost wrong canceled next styling exacacuray styling gratifications push opposite bought wants high finality brand view reasons manufacturers founded ugly american sales else aaudiempt creates value act really immediate needs months expectation adjust deal making know closes true gives doesnt adjusted financing coworkers changes pay cost made small couple large purchased literally spot strong puzzled hear expensive even funds style country selected anything exact willing financed believe customers prevents stated nowhere purchase order want less conditions make theyre inventory come said specification may always enormous ordered taken today unit entrenched 1000 favor feedback incentives since carefully well imperfect performance direction read would different pickey get culture seems result business instant involved meet options gratification styling works actually way course theory sale wait bingo world change performance got customer already dealers current something lot booked waiting evolved turn delivery beaudier one like looks products unamerican hands accepting accommodating car thcadillac psychology means everybody blank

Not so much in BMW or Benz (even if their options are limited vs. Europe, they still come with plenty of available combinations). Probability of finding my favorite combination within 300 miles is basically null. I'd like 435i Grand Coupe with sport line (but not M-sport - ripoff, well let's say ""too expensive for value"") with red exterior, black upholstery w/ red stitching, dark burl walnut wood trim, premium package, technology package, driver assistance package, harman kardon sound (negotiable), but no lighting package (ripoff), I'm flexible on wheels. No. of cars within 300 mile - ZERO. There is nothing even close, like one option missing/too many. Even compromising on the color and/or upholstery and/or trim still does me no good. So no, ""pretty much anything"" does not apply. Sport line is rare, there may be one or two units per five local dealerships - of course in a completely wrong configuration. It just so happens that my perception of value seems to be completely different than sales managers of those dealerships. I see Sport line as a highest value, because it gives you seats and suspension without all that other fluff - and you get gorgeous red on black stitching (if you choose that color) to boot.

2742,"April 28, 2015  3:17PM",markcincinnati,"Good point about ordered cars costing less than on-the-lot cars. My wife ordered a 2005 and a 2008 BMW X3 and the sales rep was quick to inform her that an ordered car gets an immediate MSRP discount of $500 (maybe it was $300, I don't remember exactly) since the dealership won't have to pay ""floorplanning"" (a.k.a., interest) fees.  I've not even attempted to order an American car, although when I test drove a new CTS, I got the sense ""it would not be necessary,"" since ""anything"" could be found using the dealer locator software. I didn't pursue this path, so I don't know how accurate that statement was.  At my dealership, my salesrep claims he would rather send people out on test drives of the various models and then sign up new customers to order the exact cars they want. He says this is because so many of their cars are ""on allocation."" Apparently, this means you will allocated so many A7's (for instance) and that is it -- be guided accordingly. This excludes ""ordered"" cars.  The Audi leasing system devalues Prestige Audis residuals, so the dealers, knowing that the vast majority of the cars they sell will be leased, order in Premium Plus models which have higher residuals, hence lower monthly payments. My wife wanted (hold on) the heated cup holder in her 2014 SQ5 -- guess what? Only comes on the Prestige model (of course). The tracking headlights, too, Prestige only.  We got around the lease penalty by buying the car @ 2% APR -- no lease residual hit. I'm assuming, however, that the trade in value will be lower since the car has virtually everything on top of being a Prestige.  Here's another issue with the current American Way of buying: there is virtually no opportunity to experience certain options, since the dealer rarely stocks cars with (for example only) Blind Spot Monitoring or Top View Camera, etc. Also it is virtually impossible to find a car with sports seats in stock since ""sport seats"" only come on cars equipped with ""summer only"" tires and here in SW Ohio, no one wants summer tires, and so on.  The Munich dealer, on the other hand, seemed to have at least ONE of everything (to test, but not to buy) so that the customer could see it, feel it, hear it, experience it and drive it.  I'm not sure what ""oh so special Europe"" suggests, but it seems somewhat of a dis. I'm not saying the [apparent] ""European way"" should be adopted here in the US. Most folks seem happy with buying off the lot -- to each his/her own self be true --and the cars that I want can still be ordered exactly as I want them, so we do have a system that certainly seems like it's working.  As a further point of clarification, hundreds of thousands of people -- check that, millions of people -- build new houses (or they hire companies and contractors to do so). I realize that many of these built houses are from ""Home Building"" companies that offer customers ""The Pemberton,"" ""The Gladstone,"" and ""The Barrington"" (or some such names) that are floor-plans that allow some customization (kind of like a car). There are also custom ""Home Builders"" that will build it entirely your way. And, there are local builders who offer highly customizabel houses based on a couple dozen blueprints. Even those who do not build their houses from the dirt up typically shop until they find the facing and floor-plan that satisfies certain criteria. Some folks take months and months of house hunting before they pull the trigger on a $400,000 house, but will turn around and buy a $40,000 car after a 15 minute test drive (and they buy car after car after car the same way). Some folks probably spend more money on cars over a 20 to 30 year real estate mortgage term than they do on the house they call home -- always settling for what's on the lot.

2750,"April 22, 2015  6:55PM",markcincinnati,"When you're bored . . .  . . . and you're 63 and your wife loves driving -- ""every mile's a smile"" -- and it is a truly beautiful day in SW Ohio (Saturday last), what do you do? Answer: You take cars out and drive them.  I must admit, I wasn't all that keen on driving a dealer's car, especially since I know and they know and I know they know I know, that neither of us are currently in the market; but my sales rep, Greg, had a 2015 S5 with the Sport Differential option (and 60 miles on the OD) just sitting there, and, well, he knows my wife doesn't have any experience behind the wheel of an Audi S car with torque vectoring (TV). The rest as they say was inevitable.  We went out for a long drive on familiar twisty (and in great condition) secondary roads. I went first at my wife's insistence to somewhat demonstrate what rear torque vectoring added to a rear-biased (60%) AWD car equipped with max performance 35 series summer only tires can do, out of the box.  As I am familiar with the road where a sign indicating 15 MPH (right turn corner) is the correct speed, according to the Ohio DOT, to navigate the turn, I know my non-TV equipped S4 can take said curve @ 45 MPH. Therefore I assume that with the summer-only super sticky tires (I do not have these) and the TV option, the TV equipped car ought to be at least good for another 5 - 10 MPH without drama.  I was proven correct in that I easily took this ""curve"" at 54 MPH with help from what feels like it could be ""The Hand of God."" Entering the corner ""hot"" (but maintaining, NOT accelerating) was a little unnerving at first, but when I reached the apex of the corner, I dialed in about an inch more lock and a like amount of throttle.  The rear end of the car was seemingly grabbed by a giant foam rubber hand and the car ""carved"" right through he corner as if something or some one had gripped the rear quarter panels low to the ground and simply pushed me through the corner, virtually drama free. Speed? Yes? A bit of a rush coming out of the apex of the curve? Oh hell yes!  Next up a left hand curve with a bit of a an opposite (from the expected and helpful) bank meaning the car was not helped at all by the highway engineer's decision to have the apex of the curve have a crown rather than a scallop. Once again, almost counter-intuitively I entered the curve hot, waited for the apex where I cut the wheel to the left (a bit) while simultaneously punching the gas ""with feeling.""  Again, the invisible hand pushed the car, as if it were on rails, through the horribly under-engineered road.  A couple of nice, virtually deserted straight-a-ways where the supercharged engine at full throttle thrilled, rounded out the first half of the ""test.""  Up next, my wife -- our idea was this: I drove the outbound route and she would drive the return route, retracing my steps (in the opposite direction). My left curves were her rights, and so on.  Once she got the hang of cutting the wheel just a bit more than seemed ""natural"" at the apex and punching the gas, she too was calling TV the hand of god.  I guess, other than sharing this with y'all, I would invite you to experience a powerful car with rear biased torque split, aggressive summer tires and a ""sport differential."" Someone once said, ""nothing else even comes close.""  I am ""OK"" with not having a car equipped with torque vectoring -- but, given a choice, I will never get another car (on purpose) without it. The Acura's SH-AWD is a great piece of tech; but, the issue is: It is installed on a car with a 90%/10% f/r torque split and the ability to shift a maximum of power to the rear of just 50%.  So while I admire and recommend only getting an Acura equipped with SH-AWD, if you're looking at the brand, I can attest that, good as it is, nothing even comes close to the implementation of TV in the S5 I drove this weekend.  Too bad I'm not in the market -- for an S4 thusly equipped would be sick.  Drive it like you live.

Volvo has partnered with Polestar and cars chipped (from the factory, of course) by Polestar are covered by the OEM warranty. I don't know if Dinan has any formal relationship with BMW that somehow protects a customer with a Dinan modded BMW from financial ruin. I don't think StaSIS modded Audis carry an official Audi warranty, but cars so outfitted by StaSIS do have a full warranty and there are actual Audi dealers who retail from the ground up StaSIS outfitted versions.  I chipped an Audi TT (MTM chip) and sometimes under full throttle, the engine would just shut off, requiring the car to be restarted. It did this intermittently, and it wasn't until we decided to trade the car in on a more powerful TT that MTM came out with the ""software patch"" that cured this issue.  Chipping, initially, is an inexpensive way to get gobs of power (mostly torque) from blown engines -- but unless the chip's effects are 100% reliable and predictable, well, I am of the opinion that I will just get a bigger meaner more powerful version of the car in question, rather than trying to patch the OEM's software for engine management.

The thing is, such upgrades of blown engines often do produce massive torque improvements (at low RPM's) -- and initially there usually does not appear to be any negative consequences of the added twist. But, over time, won't the transmission almost be expected to have a reduced lifespan?  My point would be ""let the buyer beware"" -- go with a factory approved chip provider, if one exists. If Dinan does not risk the warranty, go with them for your BMW upgrad; if APR has no affiliation with Audi, well, be guided accordingly and put about $15,000 in a bank account called ""Just In Case"" -- or just get the uprated model usually offered by the manufacturer in the first place.

In the case of BMW, the prevalent attitude is: ""Want a BMW that drives like a BMW? It's gonna cost you!""

2805,"April 19, 2015  2:14AM",markcincinnati,"Please chill -- overall, typically, generally speaking, etc, etc, things are as they are due to the market.  For example, if shoppers who become buyers would buy ""whatever"" you can bet the supplier would provide as much ""whatever"" as possible.  I live in Cincinnati -- Cincinnati surrounds a city called Norwood. Norwood WAS the city that made Firebirds and Camaros. WAS the city. The folks that built the cars did such insane things as put pop bottles in the doors, assuring the cars would be delivered with rattles. Time and time again GM would give in to the workers demands for ""whatever"""" -- predictably and obviously, but not so to the folks who actually built the cars, GM said, to hell with it, and announced the closing of the plant. Millions of dollars of salary and taxes would come to an end. The response? The workers ""threatened"" productivity.  Too little, too late.  I bought and/or leased ONLY stick shift cars through 2003. I couldn't even take my car to a full service car wash, no one knew how to drive it -- once the noise and smell of my gears grinding and clutch melting was so terrifying, I decided, ""I'm done -- the basterds (spelled that way on purpose) have won.""  YOU are the reason the cars are as they are -- I bought nearly 30 manual transmission cars (from Germany, no less) the rest of you folks were buying auto transmissions. Now, after the plant's closing you threaten productivity? Too little too late.  Now, you're being told, I gather, that if you want what ever it is that you want, you can find it in an ""M"" BMW -- well, folks, if you don't buy them, you can be 100% certain whatever it is that you think you want will be discontinued due to a lack of paying customers.  The cars are as they are due to the market's acceptance (measured in BUYERS) of whatever it is they sell.  If they sell purple, green, red and blue and no one buys a blue one -- figure out what will happen to the availability of future blue ones.  You'd think this was some sort of plot against you -- foisted upon you by evil car manufacturers who only want to produce more and more car models and configurations that no one whats?!? Pull the other one.  I don't know what is being taught today at US universities that passes for economics, but it must not include the simple explanation of demand and supply.  Have you seen some of the car ads on TV? Some of them portray the company's cars being driven by handsome men and pretty women zooming off in the ""fill in the blank"" equipped with a stick shift. Clearly some cars with virtually nil up take on the cars marketed, still market the notion that folks lust for stick shifts (for example) -- where the rubber meets the road (where the cash changes hands) the transmissions are rarely manual.  Let's talk about the upcoming reality, more and more driver aids -- less and less driver involvement -- that is where everything is heading. The reason things are heading where ever it is they are heading is MONEY.  If you think we should have BMWs like they used to be decades ago, fine -- pony up the money.  Not gonna happen, not gonna happen.  I took a long test drive of an Audi S5 with the torque vectoring rear differential option and a DSG transmission -- Old School would be run over, chewed up and spit out by this . . . nothing old school, affordable by mere mortals, even comes close to this kind of performance.

Can't really make that connection. I think the build and materials might actually be a little better in the CTS vs the 5. You don't see it that way. No problem for me. That's why they make all sorts of different cars, models at all kinds of price points. Plenty of choice for everyone.  I do like the 2.0 turbo motors that Cadillac, Audi and BMW use. I like the one in the Caddy a bit better than the other ones, though. INHU, it pulls stronger than the other two. My opinion is the CTS handles better, too. Cadillac really dialed in the suspension on the CTS.  Haven't driven the diesel in the E Class. So, I can't comment on it.  Now, if you ask me about the straight six twin scroll turbo with the performance package I had in my E92, then I'd be hard pressed to pick any of the other turbo 4s over that motor.

2839,"April 11, 2015  2:54PM",graphicguy," Mark...if I wasn't known for flipping cars every 2-3 years, I don't know that the CTS would have made it to my garage.  That said, the last GM product I owned was a Chevy Tahoe, which was well put together, uber reliable, and aside from fuel efficiency (which was at best, dismal) cheap to own and operate. But now, Tahoes are a $65-$75K step down from $80K Escalades, So, not sure I can say they're in any way shape or form, economical.  So, if I keep my CTS long enough, perhaps I can really see if GM and Cadillac have changed.  All that said, I mentioned a few months ago that I had tested an S3. Suspension was way too stuff for my tastes (a whole other level stiffer than my previous S4). Ran into one of the guys who originally helped me at the Audi dealership on the east side of town. He recognized me immediately (probably because of all the time spent at his dealership trying to get Audi to fix my car). It took me awhile to place him, but I knew him.  Kind of funny because I think at the time he was the Audi sales manager. He said he's doing something with one of the other dealerships in the dealer group. He was the ONLY one who at least tried to get Audi to swap me out of the troublesome S4, which they refused, preferringto irritate me even more and actually having to pay me to buy the car back. Go figure.  Anyway, he said he was starting at the dealer group's Porsche store next week. He wasnted to know what I was driving (didn't denegrate his Caddy competition saying he thought the CTS was a good looking car). Last day at Audi is today. Starts at Porsche on Monday.  I told him of my test drive of the S3 and that I found it way too stiff. He said he hears that a lot and blamed to high perforamnce summer tires. He said the dealership routinely swaps out the summer tires for high performance all weather tires, which makes a big difference on the ride.  He did have pics on his phone of a new S3 they have in stock that was gorgeous.....white metallic with black and grey leather interior. He said they just put all weather shoes on it and I should stop by for a test drive. He said he wanted to leave the Audi store on a bang.  Told him I was still stinging from my last go round with Audi. He didn't minimize my feelings stating he totally understood. But, he also said that was highly unusual.

2840,"April 11, 2015  7:01PM",graphicguy,"So, i actually gave the S3 another test drive. I usually don't go to any dealerships on a Saturday given they're busy and I'm not in the market. But, with the invite, I did.  Dealership had a couple of people in it, but not busy by any stretch.  Sales Manager I spoke to was there. He came over, shook my hand.

Onward...pretty car in the metallic white Still a bit cramped but felt a bit aierier than the IS350 I tests drove awhile ago. Ride is much better with the all seasons. Probably give up a little at the edges of handling, but the all season certainly would make the car more liveable on a day-to-day basis.  Seats are good, but not as good as the TL's or the CTS's. Not off by much, though. They were actually better looking than the ones I had in my previous S4. But, my S4 seats didn't have soft leather inserts, either.  Faster than my CTS by a good meadure, although the motor is still a 2.0 Turbo with more HP but less torque. Weight (less on the S3), gearing and the DSG trans are what I attribute that, too. But, the CTS is roomier. In truth, it felt about as fast as my S4.  Nice interior, as expected. Much less in the way of controls, especially on the console vs my S4. Not sure one is better than the other, just different. This one had the handwriting recognition. In my brief time with it, it was hit and miss. LCD Pollping up out of the dash is way cooler than the tacked on screen with Benz or BMW. I'm used to my CTS's interface and have mastered it. I have familiarity with the Audi MMI. Not much has changed from what I remember.  Handled well, rear danced a tad over some bumps, but it wasn't too bad. Never felt that in my S4, TL nor my CTS. LIke the CTS, lots of torque low. I like that. Not much is going to blow by you in the S3.  Steering was direct. I liked the steering wheel a lot, but I liked the one in the S4 a lot, too.  B&O stereo still trails the ELS in the TL and the (believe it or not) uplevel Bose in the CTS.  Stickered for nearly $49K. After a nice 30 minute run, I went back to the dealership, with only one customer taking delivery of an A6. SM asked how I liked it. I told him that for the money, I'd choose it over a 335i or C300. First, that kind of sticker will barely touch either of those cars. And, the S3 will outperform both.  He said he'd entice me by offering 5% off MSRP. Not in the market, and he knew I had an aversion to Audi.

2842,"April 12, 2015  2:07PM",markcincinnati,"Personal preference to be sure: the current Audi (and others) interior theme uses a pop-up screen that comes out of the dash and goes vertical when the car is started. The screen contains information I would consider to be desired at all times, so the screen is always up.  Years ago, Pioneer offered an after-market head unit that had a similar pop-up screen. My 2005, 2009 and 2014 Audis all have the screens integrated into a sweeping clean looking dash -- no clutter, no pop up screen that looks like something from a SEMA show.  In short, those pop-up screens look, to me, to be aftermarket, not well integrated and, indeed, somewhat fragile.  They are ALMOST a deal breaker. The prev gen Cadillac CTS (2012 for instance) had a much better pop-up in terms of integration.  My prediction, the pop up screens are going to go away (at least in Audis) within a year or two. Probably just the time I'll be back in the market, hoping that there is a new B9 S4.  Dealer noted to me yesterday: ""The A6 now has the S4 engine; and the S3 has equal to or better than acceleration numbers than the S4. . ."" ""Audi will not let this stand, if history is any guide -- the new S4 will bump both HP and Torque to improve performance over the S3 and to show better numbers vs the A6.""  Stay tuned.

2846,"April 13, 2015 12:43PM",dino001," That's a devastating statement from somebody who had been a fan and have spent high tens of thousands this often. My thinking is BMW doesn't feel the pinch now, because for one guy they lost, they gained couple of other customers who bought the nameplate and image, had no concept whatsoever what actual car sportiness really meant. The question is whether that sales surge is something permanent to enjoy, or temporary. One big value of enthusiasts is they provide free and most effective marketing. Many of those buying their cars today do so based on reputation built in the past, by guys like your buddy. It's hard to estimate how much that is worth, as some other people may also be turned off as well by the same enthusiast, perceiving them as juvenile snobs. It's clear that BMW has definitely lost the ""ultimate"" side for the sake of appeal to wider audience. We should see the long-term results of the move in ten-twenty years. As I recall, several other brands tried to pull that off and few succeeded.  BTW, I recall a car magazine review (don't remember which one) shortly after BMW and ATS came out. It was the 328 vs 2.0T. Reading it was almost Alice in Wonderland experience - they gave ATS higher score in most ""enthusiast"" related categories, from steering, to road feel, to some standard performance tests. Yet, 328 was still a ""overall winner"" and they really didn't explain why. My thought was they simply ""grandfathered"" it into top position and knocked out ATS on some creature comfort items (like that touch screen interface, they said was a four-letter word). In other words, ATS was an ultimate driving machine of the two, but 328 was better to own at the time - which I find plausible, but it was an ""enthusiast"" test.",hard temporary driving people word fourleaudier free big dont plausible related review comfort feel several brands road reputation permanent machine effective guys worth meant almost thousands pinch concept came past guy bought fan high results simply words sales value really alice whether thought see side explain touch buddy many enjoy much still doesnt statement whcadillacoever marketing gave didnt appeal juvenile standard devastating couple categories provide nissante performance wonderland test overall interface bmw enthusiast items higher buying enthusiasts thinking cadillac recall customers vs position screen creature yet winner performanceiness two pull somebody lonforderm years said top nameplate may often snobs today score perceiving tens definitely well time surge steering spent built tried btw image turned shoracuray sake gained knocked cars actual nissanion find something move experience beaudier wider estimate one clear like magazine also audience based tests succeeded reading car tentwenty 20t rememercedeser thcadillac grandfathered lost

However, the price is quite high when well equipped, to me \ from my point of view.  For example: Although the motor is certainly a very good 4 cylinder, it is still a 4 cylinder – and does not really make the sort of sounds I associate with the price point. Ultimate acceleration is certainly acceptable, but I prefer more immediate torque delivery from low RPM. It does pull well, once RPM & boost climb. The DCT & final drive gearing requires much, MUCH higher RPM in top gear at cruising speeds than I prefer.  The interior rear view mirror is absurdly small.  The sunroof has only a mesh cover \ sunshade – not a solid one. Here in HotLanta, that is really not a good idea. . .  Although handling inspired confidence, I agree regarding the ride quality. Part of that may also be the S3’s relatively short wheelbase.  The interior materials seemed appropriately high quality, and the seats were comfortable and supportive. With full leather seating, I do appreciate the fact that cooling is available for those seats in the Charger – and it works really well!  I liked the fact that the S3’s center armrest adjusts up\down & fore\aft – a nice touch. I do prefer the nav screen being in the dash, instead of popping up above it.

Another proof it takes so much more than just make a good product once. You have to do it again and again - and again. I guess if it took them four decades to destroy the company, it may take them twice as long to rebuild it - and only if the product quality remains up.  I wonder what kind of deals are out there. Or perhaps, GM reduced the incentives in some major way and buyers, used to them, refused to buy at near the list price. This happens sometimes. Midspring inventory glut is a bad sign - too far away for the ""all new"" model with a new rear spoiler and wheel package, all that metal eating the dealers' financing. Also, GM used to be notorious for overproducing and the doing fire sales. Old habits die hard? I really wonder why is it so bad for a product that ain't that bad at all. Perhaps it all comes down to price.  GM and Cadillac have chicken and egg problem, for sure. They want to be considered equal to the Germans, so they list price their cars accordingly. But because that's not the reality for now (at least in minds of the public), they have to concede on incentives - which perpetuates the situation. They could reduce the production, but the have to sell certain minimum volume to stay in business. It's a tough business, for sure. I think they need to overhaul their thinking in terms of not just product, but sales expectations, production, relationships with dealers, etc and model it more like those German guys. For example, BMW has quotas and allotments, but it's dealers, not the region, who decides on actual configurations within those allotments. There are (or at least used to be, when I got mine) reserved features (like some colors), which require a real customer order (in other words, those are special order only). I heard it's common for purchasing managers to fake customers to get those on their lot. I wonder if Cadillac dealers have similar system, or do they have to take whatever Detroit guys send them (I heard that was the case for lower-tier brands).",hard germans fake refused deals think bad within takes stay im proof product eating volume system long old could minimum near brands concede take guys styling aint real perpetuates twice public region surprising fan brand words list similar sales really sell notorious much happens situation least financing another need mine features special sometimes quotas stretch hondaingly reduce send major fire even midspring bmw minds expectations imagination good away new egg thinking terms took cadillac customers chicken german order company want remains kind far managers make inventory glut decades reality quality tough case may purchasing detroit production wonder four die reserved whatever heard incentives overhaul used read stylings overproducing guess perhaps considered get price habits buyers common lowertier business example certain way cars allotments buy actual sign package etc require gm got equal relationships sure customer rear reduced dealers lot problem quite decides configurations like rebuild weekend also thing metal comes thcadillac spoiler destroy

Currently, an A6 can be sort of had with sport seats, but, as I noted previously they are called Individual Contour Seats -- they seem to be a cross between the standard A6 seats and my S4 seats, plus massage and ventilation -- but the bolsters are not quite as prominent as in the S4.  I'm with those of you who consider the seats a deal breaker if they aren't what I want.  Most of the above cars that had sport seats that were optional came with a maximum price of $1,000 and a normal price of $500 -- even adjusted for inflation, I can't figure out why not offer the options that people want -- IF YOU ALREADY market them in other geographies.  I wondered for years what the big deal was about NOT offering heated REAR seats -- the cost of the seat warmers is probably quite low and a $250 - $500 up charge seems like a no-brainer. Finally, with respect to Audi at least, heated rear seats are at least offered for an extra charge.  I signed onto the Audi Exclusive web page, and there are many optional choices for interior treatments that can be had -- yet, it is clear it is very difficult to order sportier seats via that exclusive program if they are not normally offered in your market. The Audi Exclusive program seems more like a decorating option than a functional one -- not that that is a bad thing.  While I am ranting, I really don't get why so many things are bundled together into one mid-four-figure ""package"" -- if all I want is a top-view camera, it appears I have to take automatic cruise control, w/stop and start, lane keeping assistance and pre-sense plus. Now, I'd gladly buy top view and pre-sense plus, but paying for lane assist and cruise control with full-stop, start capabilities does not, today at least, interest me.  My belief is that folks do things based on what is marketed to them within certain cost parms.  I am not keen on paying for a seat massage function, when all I am after is bolstered chairs in the first place, so, I am likely to pass on the expensive option, and, without that option, I am likely to pass on the car and HOPE that the next gen A4 line will amp up both the L and the P.

It would seem that everyone here appears to have an opinion that, to me, reads something like (speaking of the Germans): The way fill-in-the-blank"" (usually filled in with BMW) cars were during the fill-in-the-blank (usually some year or range of years that is at least 5 years ago, often as much as 15) is better than they are today. The author of said opinion/perspective will usually attribute their reasons for stating the ""fact"" of better then than now, to be the current difficulty in getting today's version with a stick shift or the increase in luxury content at the expense of performance, the selection by the manufacturer of run flat tires or whatever other dislike is currently popular.  Far as I can tell, however, the German auto makers Audi, BMW and Mercedes (and probably Porsche, but not as often mentioned) were not humbled THEN and therefore are highly unlikely to have been ""further"" humbled by Acura, Lexus and Infiniti.  Current auto review magazine's still typically pick a European over an Asian, and more to the point, typically pick a German over a Japanese. When there is a ""comparo"" report between the Japanese ELLPS or LPS and the offering from Germany (in the same class), the German's usually finish ahead of their Japanese rival (the one glaring example to the contrary is when the Lexus IS bested the BMW 3, and that was over a year ago).  Generally, the German examples rule the category -- far as I can tell if there is any humbling, it is the exception rather than the rule.  I so wanted to love the Q50 Infiniti (at the time I was in a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD) and did end up ordering a IS 350 with the F-sport package when I thought I would be forced to ""settle"" for a Lexus to replace the Acura, thinking, at the time, an Audi will be too expensive to be considered, compared to the IS 350.

The car handles nicely, but again, not inspiring. The interior is fine, but I remember preferring the TSX's interior. I much preferred the TL-SH-AWD models I test drove last year. For closer to $35K than $40K (sticker overpriced, but real deals were to be had), the TL SHAWD made a compelling case. For nearly the same money, the TLX does not IMHO.

2888,"April 10, 2015  7:31PM",markcincinnati,"dino - I guess I should add, too, that I don't actually know that the Japanese LPS brands have previously been humbled, either -- but I think (my opinion) they have, or at least they should be since they so frequently are NOT the winner in comparos in the BIG, IMPORTANT car magazines.  I saw MotorWeek on TV this week and the Lexus GS was tested (not compared), things went along nicely as the car was shown on the track and street -- and then WHAM! John Davis pretty much put the car in its place (which was to say, it was NOT at the top of the Premium car heap, based on comments about handling, braking, etc),  Yet, ""everyone"" I know who has a Lexus loves them -- of course whenever I ask why, the reason, THE reason, THE #1 REASON, the ONLY reason I can ever get out of them, is either how reliable or durable they are.  Odd, methinks, how I can't ever seem to elicit a comment about a Lexus, Infiniti or Acura that praises their performance, style, switchgear -- oh oh oh, I take it back, once, someone told me how good the sound system in his Acura is (and speaking as a previous Acura TL SH-AWD Advance owner, I agree -- Acura has the best sound systems for mere mortals -- the only one that is better is the hyper expensive B&O option Audi offers for $6,000+).  Don't get me wrong, a sound system is very important in a car -- but, you know, when someone tells me about their 5 series or their new Mercedes E or C, they tell me about the performance, ergonomics, 8-speed or 7-speed transmission, engine, responsiveness, cornering, etc, etc, etc.  My wife thinks that her Infiniti was great -- from a durability (and probably reliability) standpoint. But she ended up with an SQ5 (Audi) because ""Infiniti's ain't got no soul."" She was against my getting a 2014 IS 350 for the same reason -- told me, I'd be underwhelmed by it's appliance-like disposition.  I do appreciate, too, that I've read, here, the comments -- positive comments -- about the recent EL and LPS Cadillac offerings.

2889,"April 10, 2015  8:08PM",dino001,"To me Lexus has been traditionally perfect car for people who don't care about cars (don't get excited about them, don't want to know anything about how throttle or gears work, don't watch any motor sports, etc.), but need a car and want one that is going to be comfortable, well designed, high quality today and five years from now, reliable, low maintenance and yet tell everybody they have both money and taste. BTW, I remember one guy stating repeating couple of times low depreciation as a primary reason he got a Lexus. I have always bought a car for myself, not the next guy, but I understand his thinking - if all he wanted was to minimize the cost and maximize the content, Lexus was just perfect for him. Just like Toyota is perfect for the same kind of people with less money. BTW, this is probably 80% of the population, if not more.  I'm not looking down on those people, not at all - they have their busy lives, they don't need or want to know anything about weight distribution, cornering ability. I'm sure they have other passions that I could not care less about.  However, over time, Lexus noticed that they left that over 20% of those with means to buy their cars wouldn't even give them time of the day - so they change their product (a little) and advertising (a lot - most of their ads are about ""F"" lines even if they actually sell small fraction of those). BMW did the opposite - they have owned those 20% for decades - the 80% majority would stay away, unless the lease payment was right and even after then they would constantly complain about small back seat and ""harsh"" suspension, or road noise, tire wear, or all those things we know sporty cars do (including higher maintenance). So in order to grow, BMW changed their product (unlike Lexus, they changed it a lot). They don't really miss that 20%, because those guys still have nowhere else to go and all they can do is grumble.

2890,"April 10, 2015  8:09PM",markcincinnati," Whatever humbling happened to Audi it certainly was not at Acura's hand if that is what your comment suggests -- Audi was humbled because they were first maligned by a 60 Minutes story that made the preposterous claim that an Audi 5000's 5-cylinder engine could overpower its brakes (which it couldn't); then it was hobbled by its own hand because it was so ARROGANT it its response to the 60 Minutes piece (which Audi knew was false but didn't have the ability to see was the PERCEPTION the Minutes piece left the viewers with) that they said, American drivers are so ham-footed that they can't press the right pedal (or, the lie, that if you pressed both the accelerator and brake pedal of an Audi the engine was sooo powerful it would make the car lurch forward).  So, yes, Audi was humbled [perhaps] -- but NOT by Acura, Audi was humbled by Audi. Their reaction to the fake news of the day was what nearly done 'em in.  The Lexus LS may have -- in hindsight -- captured the buying public's eye for a ""cheaper"" and ""similar"" [to a Mercedes S, well, sorta] car -- today a top o' the line Lexus attracts shoppers for the reasons I noted, then, well, no one knew they were going to be so durable, but they were cheaper (but the Hyundai Equus is cheaper than an LS is today, too, though). Then, I don't recall that Lexus actually took too much out of Mercedes pockets. The only country Lexus was sold in was the US (OK, North America). Even today, a company like Audi sells 175,000 cars in the US (out of total sales of over 1.2M). So while we're important for the image (which is huge), we're not so much important in revenue -- and then, well, most folks couldn't even spell globalization.  I would think the Germans and the Japanese alike are always looking at the market, their direct competition, their indirect competition and what is looming on the horizon that could be trouble.  I assume they're all a bit concerned (too strong a word?) by the product coming out of Korea -- and even the American manufacturers are no longer to be ignored.  So, my retort is pretty much that Audi, not Acura was the cause of the dark days (with an honorable mention at least to the inaccurate 60 Minutes story Unintended Acceleration) for that brand -- and far as I can tell Audi's behavior could hardly have been more opposite to humble if it tried even harder.  Mercedes, even when they were somehow supposedly threatened by Lexus wasn't really put out much by the product, as much as they were put out by the hype -- and even so, the US (at that time) was still a pretty small peanut insofar as sales+image were concerned, compared with the rest of the planet's uptake of Mercs.  And, while I pretty much agree about BMW's -- a 1980's era BMW was still a bit of a rarity and were known for being ""breathtakingly expensive"" to maintain and god help you if you needed to repair one or take one to a body shop.  The folks I knew who knew or thought they knew about cars (remember I'm old enough to have been alive then) in the early '80's often would equate BMW's and Porsche's -- and some folks even had the gall (or ignorance) to tell me that BMW stood for British Motor Works.  I'm still of the mind that if anyone is doing any humbling, it's the Germans who be the ""humble -ers,"" not the ""humble -ees.""  Check out the new Car and Driver comparo (spoiler alert, the ""long in the tooth"" S5 kicks butt and takes names AGAIN! -- wonder how the Lexus fares? Hmmm?)

2891,"April 10, 2015  8:10PM",andres3," I think you've hit the nail on the head. If I would have spent somewhere between $10 and $15K less on a TL-SH-AWD from my S4, I would have done so to save the money, get a better sound system, and perhaps enjoy legendary Acura reliability hassle free low cost maintenance ownership.  Ultimately I decided on the S4 because it looked better inside and out (style), drove faster, quicker, class leading transmission system, handled better/sharper/faster, the brakes felt better, the Quattro seemed superior to SH-AWD (less of a FWD with AWD on-demand type thing like Acura), and I could get it with contrasting Napa Leather interior (chose the Magma Red; beautiful). Also, I could choose Misano Red exterior whereas with Acura you have to settle with a purple looking red.  Lastly, I know the S4 is very easily tune-able, as I'm now driving an S4 that is as fast as an RS4 at 395-to 405 HP with just a simple REVO flash software tune. Your power varies based on the quality of gas and conditions like temperature. Get 93 or 100 octane gas and you can easily get to 410-415 HP. I do feel the difference. It is as if the car is doing what it was always meant to do now, performing the way the engine can perform without restrictions, limiters, & regulations being in its way! Without making concessions to the EPA, emissions, nannies, fuel economy, and insurance company charge rates (I think this is why Audi under rates the power in its cars), the S4 is a BEAST. I think 400 HP is a new magical number. Of course, 300 HP would suffice if the car was 500+ lbs. less.  Granted, if you don't have a heavy right foot, you can still keep the EPA happy with your gas mileage. I see no negative effects in daily driving. Just positive effects when you get into it!

To next experience such chairs, you skip over the A6 and go straight to the S6 -- which, let's get real, usually is tickling the underbelly of $80,000.  The S6, by some crazy metrics, is actually a bargain compared to the other guys, but jeeeeze, what if I simply wanted a very nice A6 with the new supercharged V6 engine and SLINE, not ""S""?  Fughettaaboutdit.  In my case, I love the SIZE of the A4/S4 and am anticipating a nicer package job in the B9 S4 -- so assuming the seats are still offered in that model, I need not coax the missus into the ""logic"" of an S6.  BTW, there is NO logic in an S6, it is pure emotion at that point -- the thing is wicked quick, super fast and beyond sublime. I haven't driven a latter day S8 yet, but I just can't imagine ever needing one of those.  The S6 is irrational -- which is why we all want one (if we have driven one). But a new gen S4 may be a better performer, more fun and quicker through the twisties (and I am NOT speaking about ever tracking any of these). The fact that a new S4 ""nicely equipped"" can be had for under $60K is just a bonus.  My wife and I are ""60"" years old -- we have a Sheltie and we each have a job. We have no kids at home (other than the dog) and life is pretty much low stress, so we have time to indulge one of our hobbies, test driving cars. Having said that, I urge you to go to an Audi dealer and just sit in an S4 (or an S6) and enjoy the seats. I don't mean to persuade you to the Audi brand as much as I am trying to get us all on a level conversation field -- and that is this: good seats are the enemy of great seats. You may think your ""fill-in-th-blank"" prospective ELLPS or LPS car has good seats -- and it may be thus. You may actually find better seats than Audi deems fit to put in its S cars -- and if you do, for god's sake please share. And, I'm already pretty much a fan of Volvo seats and Porsche seats, so those don't need to be discussed.  My point is, if you don't have to find a sitter or arrange your schedules to spend your weekends driving cars, take a detour to the showroom noted and try the S4's seats out.  Were I able to check a box and make these seats available across the ELLPS and LPS universe, I would. Who knows, were seats this good available from several manufacturers, perhaps I could see myself driving another brand.  Of course, if you want, you could even test drive the car to see how great seats make driving all that much more fun.

It was a clear cultural thing - for too long the mainstream here believed that a car seat should look like a couch: flat, unbolstered bench with supersoft, but short cushions and non-adjustable low head restraints (aka neck breakers) was the ""good seat"". Just a look at an old Chevy, Buick, or Ford (GM was the worst though, hands down) made my back and neck hurt. Seems American public learned since then and so did the manufacturers.  However, Germans have always known how to make good car seats. They just don't care enough to give us one in their base price, which is inexcusable, IMHO.  As I keep owning my BMW and really like it, I became quite disgruntled with the way they market and price their product. Not so much about the pricing level (because in comparison to Europe and other markets we have it really good here), but the sneaky way they put the content together and sometimes truly embarrassing configurations. Besides the front seats, my other ""favorite"" is fold-down seats, which used to be $500 option on previous generations and still remains one on 320 line (now standard on 328/335).

You could argue you need the creature comforts of a premium car, the nice sound system, and other features you enjoy. There's a reason someone buys a luxury sport vehicle, and you can't just replace it with an old Chevy Impala rental because it's as big or bigger and has 4-doors.  As to being insured for HPDE events, as of about a year ago, Geico specifically has made an effort to exclude it in the policy. However, you wouldn't be suing for insurance coverage while your at the track, you'd be suing for ""loss of use,"" as very few cars are track-suitable, or as fun to drive as an S4.

I'm a classic example of purchasing an entry level luxury car, having a great experience, and moving from $30K for the A3 to nearly $55K (out the door) for the '14 S4. If I was an entry level buyer today, I'm not sure the current A3 would do it for me. I feel the '06 A3 was a better value and car for the time. Essentially, it has been 9 years and the entry level A3 is inferior to my '06 A3 in a lot of ways, plus costing more.

At the track I noticed I had developed some bad habits though, as it's possible to under steer and push the S4 around a turn, and still be able to rotate the car with the rear diff at the same time.

Today it is the rare BMW that cannot be had with AWD.  The reason for the proliferation of AWD models is -- wait for it -- because they are popular, they sell well and if you don't offer an LPS or ELLPS with AWD, and all of your competition does, you will lose market share, lose revenue, lose profit, and you will lose your job.

Aside from what appears to be a very successful ad campaign for the brand with McConnehey (sp?), I'm not sure how they can sustain the models they have if their only differentiation from the similar Ford models is a little chrome on the grill and some interior differences.

My wife took her 2014 SQ5 to the dealer service dept for the 35K service interval. This dealer typically aligns the car they offer the customer as their loaner car with the customer's actual car. Well, of course they don't have loaner SQ5's (didn't even think they would); so they offer her an S4. She said, ""Since my husband has an S4, could you put me in something that I don't normally have access to?"" Service adviser -- who knows us well -- says, ""Sure, what would you like?""

The A6 is, hmm, sublime, it is so smooooth and powerful and almost eerily quiet. The thing accelerates with a great deal of urgency but somehow behind the wheel there is virtually no drama. There's a certain tightness to the suspension (better be, it had the sport suspension and upsized wheels and tires) -- I got the sense this (relatively) large car was proving itself to be damn near nimble.  And, at $59K, it is about the same MSRP as my S4. I could see myself driving this thing -- it has more comfort, but it appears to give up but little in responsiveness to the wheel and whip.  Then I get into a stretch that I know from many years of experience is full of twisties and off-camber turns and those kind of ""liquid potholes"" -- undulations in the pavement that have yet to break through to the substrate.

Being a lifelong resident of New England, and a skier, I never had any real issues with FWD and all-season tires (until my lovely '05 Acura TL). I told folks why add the price, complexity and performance/MPG drain of AWD when FWD and snow/winter tires would likely be more than enough 99% of the time? Even FWD with all-seasons got me where I was going. Of course, ground clearance is another factor...  But, my TL was just not as good in the snow as previous FWD'ers. So, I bought snow tires on dedicated alloys (great deal at Tire Rack) and that problem solved. I had plenty of room to store four tires, and the cost of the tires/2x yearly swap was still less $ than AWD options. Of course, then I want nutsy, cuckoo and traded the TL for the V8/RWD Jaguar XK. With Summer tires. My first RWD, a whole new world of no go in snow. I mean, 1/8"" and I couldn't get out of my driveway! Luckily I had the option of an AWD SUV...  But, man plans and God laughs.

Of course, with the traction/stability control, snow mode tranny and good snows, I likely wouldn't have had any issues as, generally, a good job is done in snow plowing around here (even with 10' of snow this winter!). But, with nowhere to store a set of tires/rims (without paying to do so), I chose the path of least resistance and went AWD. No worries about the freak storm before/after snows have been swapped or storage and charges to swap tires.  So, I pay for my laziness. Need AWD? No. Glad I have AWD? Yes.

My wife will not have a car without AWD here in Colorado even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year.   Here's ""a"" thing -- not the thing, a thing: The list of BRANDs we discuss here (and elsewhere) that do not offer AWD versions of their models has diminished to an incredibly small number. Perception is reality is the phrase we live by, even if we don't always agree. The perception is that the higher performing models from Audi, BMW and Mercedes (just to name the Germans for an example) now offer AWD virtually if not literally and I think we're closing in on literally, across their entire lines. Porsche, clearly not an LPS generally speaking, has 20 different cars for sale all called 911's -- I believe they are all offered with AWD. And, often the ones (of any ilk, brand or type) that achieve the most ""wins"" are the AWD models.  But, even if that were not true -- what really matters is what people buy. Pull into a parking lot of a high zoot country club and look at the trunk emblems on the carefully parked high buck LPS (or, of you ike ELLPS) cars -- the majority of them will be xdrive, CTS or ATS4's, or quattros or four-matics or AWD badged in some way.  Let's assume that my wife and your wife, knowing that they can only actually REQUIRE AWD for about 2-5 days per year (for go power in snow); and that they could probably go if they would use winter tires with FWD or RWD, just fine, were asked if they would give up AWD. I am positive the answer from my wife would be, ""don't take away my AWD.""  The perception and the sales have been pointing to AWD, automatic transmissions, not naturally aspirated engines, more than 6 speeds in the transmission (or at the very least, nothing less than 6 speeds) and more and more electronic driving aids.  Entry level may have started off as meaning ""cheaper versions"" of higher line cars from a given mfg. And, as a practical matter, at base, no options, that is, MSRP, that is still true. But I am today convinced (by virtue of what the dealer folks tell me) that the only reason for a given BASE MSRP is the tv commercial and the lease price. And, even that is changing -- now the tv ads tout the car that is being advertised for $X pre month is ""nicely equipped"" -- if you hit the pause button and read the fine print, the cars being advertised are more and more likely to no longer be base models. Unless mandated to do so, you would be hard pressed to even find a base price model at a dealership.  The reason is no one will buy one of this class of car NEW at least without the ""premium"" package on it, so dealers stock their lots -- since most Americans won't orders cars, cause they have to have it today -- with cars that are popularly equipped. This translates to a lot, but not all, of the options on the check sheet.  I spoke to a German dealer rep who thought we (Americans) were crazy for ""always"" putting sunroofs in our cars since those of us who have them rarely, if ever, open them. Big bucks for a vestigial options. It is virtually impossible to get a German car sans sunroof -- and if you try, well you for sure throw yourself into a class of car that the leasing organizations will not sub-vent, because they have the experience with a market that won't buy a car that doesn't have a sunroof, even if no one ever opens them.  The point of all of this is to say, OK, I'll concede the historical meaning of ELLPS meant ""low cost"" -- but what is now ELLPS, then would have to be A3's, but NOT A4's (the B9's will certainly cost more than the B8's, even at base, strippie levels.) Then we need somewhere to put the A4's, 3 series and C class's -- to say nothing of some of the other ""premium"" offerings from Asia and America.  If you agree about the use of the term Entry Level as not necessarily being about $, the M3, for instance is the Entry Level M car -- and, at this point in time, there is no Entry Level RS car, unless you accept that Audi has chosen for whatever reason to only offer an RS4 as a ""station wagon"" -- and one, even at that, that cannot be had in the US.  We can go on about our business, and as long as we do not violate the terms of use of the Edmunds organization, who cares if we agree or disagree or agree to disagree about size or base MSRP.  I'm interested in speaking with, in print, folks who love (or at least like) luxury performance sedans -- and, here, luxury performance sedans that are compacts -- thus ruling out their big brothers and sisters, the 5's, E's, etc.  Even then, if someone is shopping for a 5 and goes with a 3 or a 7, I would find their thoughts and comments of interest.  If LPS is supposed to include ""I wish I was an LPS car"" type of vehicle, I'm not interested so much.  I think the VW CC or Passat are good cars -- interesting cars, perhaps even desirable cars, but today I don't think they are members of the LPS club. But they certainly are priced lower, for the most part. It's just they aren't LPS class cars. If we're looking to discuss them, we all know where to go.  The reason for the A3 and CLA (for example)? According to the two dealers I spoke with, the reason for these new, less expensive models is that the ELLPS variants typically sell for a number beginning with either a high four number or a low five number -- these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time.  I believe Mercedes is just following the Alfred P Sloan model -- start them out with a Chevy and hopefully they'll eventually buy a Cadillac. Start them out with a CLA and maybe someday they'll be back for an S Class.  It could work.  I think entry level is a name that needs some rethinking. The lower cost of the ELLPS vs the LPS is, apparently, a function of the wheelbase, length overall and width of the model -- back to the EPA classification, if you will.",strippie people comfort rs big month dont p term virtually audis im disagree include bucks wont mandated either meaning rather ok performances zoot name 25 dealer give type list sloan buconsolen changing really thought sell pointing beginning badged true doesnt performance mercedesss need cost instance line small performance audi ever cc opens even start higher mercedes new sheet es snow want mfg look width maaudiers thoughts nicely often aspiration vestigial sisters mercedessss commercial subarus hondaing shopping would different per trunk edmunds actually sale cars hit performance numercedeser offered sure ill print dealers wagon go someday desirable fourmatics like 7 magazines c size sans following volkswagen yeah apparenacuray point impossible safety wins closing aids theyll memercedesers performance 1015 long ike asked brands equipped take comments ensafety premium work americans stylingado chevrolet versions hopefully sales historical lps trade levels needs msrp base mercedesssification 5s crazy assume performance overall rarely epa country terms family elsewhere check five less two discuss allow orders station rethinking spoke likely performances chosen parking since carefully year well try 5 time speaking lots alfred options lines days pre organization part rep porsche use cause nothing unless puaudiing cts car compacts called 911s clearly germans driving ataudis winter performance market answer wife performances accept brothers variants subvent say interested america pause across performing low brand stylingbase tout practical dealership much certainly supposed club lower 37500 buck someone expensive bmw stylings love lenfordh reality incredibly always though us today function four naturally ones vehicle read get price maaudier convinced styling join virtue necessarily probably buy package somewhere tv goes throw thing emercedeslems entry ellps hard leasing think phrase started fine ilk looking typically could cheaper longer 6 concede positive knowing meant folks next generally high electronic open arent interesting back reason x know still thus least asia cares maybe literally translates popularly advertised offer 3 good away heres cadillac achieve believe vs tell without lease german offerings stock pull priced may performance ruling whatever perception agree organizations parked perhaps aspirated ads business example way live etc require lets find pressed lot interest put experience 57500 20 eventually one level diminished violate majority given sedans

2991,"March 30, 2015 12:55PM",graphicguy,"All good points. The starting numbers, for all cars, are now in the high teens. Those prices are populated by the Fiat 500, Kia Soul, Hyundai Accent, Cruise, Fiesta, etc. Most, if not all, sacrifice one or the other portions or power, refinement, quality of materials, material quality, etc. Sometimes sacrificing a lot of everything. That's how they get to those price points.  Some manufacutrer have become quite clever. They'll wrap their ""cheap"" cars in innovative styles. Look close enough, and it's hard to mask the underlying cost cutting.  When you move up that ladder, into the Civics or Accords, Corollas or Camry, Fusion, Malibu, Mazda 3 or 6, etc., you crack that $25K price, with the best of them hitting the low $30s.  From my perception, that's where the A3, CLA, 320i, ILX, probably a 2.5L ATS want to play (I suppose you can throw the Infiniti G in there, but that's pretty old these days). Not the best those brands can do, but it gets you in the door of the brand. 3 year lease is over, You think, I'm making a little more money, and boy was that C Class ever sexy looking when I was last in the showroom and hopefully, if you had a good experience with the previous car, you're driving off in a $45K C Class, or A4, or 328, loaded up TLX, or an ATS with the better drivetrain, with more options.  All of a sudden, all those promises of having a good portfolio and compound interest are starting to bear fruit. Now, you're in the $50K-$60K bracket. Now, you're looking at E Class, A6, CTS. You wouldn't dream of sullying your driveway with an Impala (even though it's every bit as good as an XTS).  Mark, you're right. That's what Sloan started, and the hope for all these brands, how they want to ""hook"" you from the start.  Where Mercedes and BMW seem to have an advantage, they've positioned themselves as aspirational brands. Cadillac used to be there. I think some of that is still there. Their missteps have cost them some of that, though. I've not driven an A3. But, I have driven an S3. Fun car. To live with it everyday? Probably wouldn't be my choice. Test drove a CLA.

3039,"March 27, 2015  8:33PM",markcincinnati,"QB: wouldn't that mean that the Audi S4 (not RS) and the BMW 335 (not M) would be ineligible? I know we can (and do) discuss pretty much whatever we want here (within certain parameters) but we would really narrow the category and the forum(s) down quite a bit if we put a cap of $39,999 as a starting point; unless of course you meant the 335 would be allowed in because there are 3 series cars that do fit this criteria.  Thus: a 320 ""invites"" all ""3"" class cars along with it.  I do not have access to ""unlimited"" funds (as a practical matter, few of us do, even the 2%-ers) -- but my search and the folks I know and ""fraternize"" with (middle and upper-middle class earners) typically buy/lease within a 2 class range. Example: my neighbor says he's looking at BMWs. I say ""what model?"" He says, ""probably a 5 series, the 3 is too small, maybe a 7 series, I'll have to see what kind of deal I can get.""  One day, I see what I presume is a new 535ix with dealer plates in his driveway. As I pass, I roll down my window and stop to ask, ""is that the new ride?"" He says, ""they gave it to me for the weekend, I have to take it back Monday, I dunno."" I say, ""you'll really appreciate the X-drive if we have another winter like this one.""  He says, ""no poop?!?"" (not really).  Next time I drive by -- a few days later, I see a new 7 series in the driveway with temp tags on it. When I see him next, I ask him about it. He tells me, ""the lease payment on this car wasn't much more than the payment on the 5 and this thing is loaded -- I couldn't turn it down.""  Now, for all I know he was set on a 7 series all along -- he is a tall drink of water. But I think he was assuming the 5 series would be fine and fit the financial parms he and his wife had set. Well, when for a ""little more"" he could have a 7 series, well it was probably NOT an agonizing decision.  The thing that cracks me up is what ""always"" happens (and if you don't believe me, spend some time on Audiworld's forums): the new fill-in-the-blank is acquired (purchased, financed or leased) and about 15 minutes later, the proud new owner is browsing Tire Rack, APR, (fill in the blank for your brand of LPS car) etc for ""all the stuff"" that this brand new owner will buy to modify his (or her) new ride.  I have seen -- again, over on Audi World -- folks announce the new A4 they've just ordered, then announce that the car is at the dealer, then post picture of the new car (while it is still at the dealership) with the title of the post ""Let the Mods Begin.""  Folks (broad generalization) buy/lease any of these cars that can genuinely and without qualification be in the ""something"" LPS class and then dump another dump-truck of money on aftermarket tires and wheels, engine management chips, pullies, exhaust systems, brakes, lights, spoilers, coil-overs, audio systems, nav systems, headlights, tail-lights, interior treatments, and . . . (the list goes on and on and on -- thank you SEMA).  It seems to me if you have ""graduated"" to the luxury performance sedans (etc), that you can, practically speaking, pretty much afford anything you damn well please.  The wheels and tires alone ""y'all"" spring for on an otherwise very well equipped 335 or Q50 or S4 cost a young fortune -- yet ""y'all"" go ahead and plunk down the forty-nine, eleventy-twelve thousand dollars on the car and then just for grins put on a $2,400 set of rims with $1,200 worth of rubber on them without batting a freakin' eye.  What really cracks me up is the folks who acquire an A4 and then spend thousands on engine, suspension and tire and wheel mods so that they can create what they designate as an AS4 -- when for another $50 a month they could've had an S4 and be done with it (and the warranty would still be in full force, too).  One A4 buyer purchased one without navigation and then worked and worked until he found all of the parts required to retro-fit the Audi OEM nav system into the thing -- talk about costing a fortune. I often wonder, why not buy an A4 and see how much money and sweat it will take to fit the DSG transmission in place of the 8-speed tiptronic.  It ain't the money that compels ""our"" actions in this class of car -- at least as far as the fan site participants are concerned. Some of the aftermarket audio systems, too, cost more than a new 4K 79"" UHDTV.  AMEX - don't leave home without it.

The A3 is a sub compact, the A4 is a compact. If this is to be about sub-compacts, well I guess that is OK, but then we would need yet another cubby hole to poke the B8 Audis and the entire lineup of 3's. These are LPS cars -- but a bit smaller. In some instances it is easily possible to have the 3 series priced at more than the 5 series.  Is there a debate about the ""maximum"" MSRP (base) for the full sized LPS's?  It may well be true that a 335 would fit a $45K ceiling (for an RWD only version), but -- according to the BMW dealership here in River City -- over 40%, of all 3 series sold are AWD. And, here in our climate, I was told the number now favors the x - drive versions as the majority sold.  The 3 series -- from bottom to top -- are in the compact class. MSRP ranges from a number beginning with a $3 to a number beginning with a $6.  There are NO 335's with a window sticker under $50K, unless someone has deliberately ordered one totally stripped. There are no S4's under $50K either -- but I have seen S4 manual transmission versions with but one option that squeak by at a hair over $50K.  Likewise, I shopped the IS350 Fsports and they were ALL over $50K (if they were AWD).  We need to talk about either sub-compacts or compacts here. Since the MSRP's (from a practical standpoint) are all over the board, we need to think, for example, 3 series, not 3 series until they exceed $40 or $45K.  Those who lease (apparently the majority) shop mo pay, not MSRP. And those who do buy, well, of course they're welcome too. I am simply arguing to be inclusive.

They said so repeatedly. It may be because they live by their memories (what it used to cost), or perhaps by simply how much they could afford. For myself, I don't look at cars at their base. If I can't afford its mid-to-high option version, the car is not for me. I see no point is a stripper, but I understand why somebody may actually go for it. But that vantage point difference is very real. I generally agree with inclusion of 335 in this class, but it barely squeaks into.

3074,"March 25, 2015  8:39PM",markcincinnati,"I guess I'm coming 'round to the notion that -- and this is only for example purposes -- both the A3 and A4 could be called ELLPS vehicles (but if I am doing so it is kicking and screaming). This whole thing is so darned subjective though, since I still harbor the notion that (pre A3), the A4 was ELLPS (even though you can crank the S4 to close to $70K) as [because?] the A6 was an LPS.  The ATS is ELLPS as the CTS is [now] LPS; as 3 series is ELLPS as 5 series is LPS.  Now, when the CLA and the A3 came along (and to a certain extent the ILX) we dropped from ""regular fit,"" to ""slim,"" and then finally to ""petite"" (sort of).  To some here EL is an indication of price -- but even those who go to the trouble can find the $ range for a 3 series to be from $32K to $87K.  I have -- historically -- thought of the ELLPS to be mostly a smaller version of the LPS family. Meaning size seems to (in MY mind) still be a better trait than cost. Hell, for the price of my S4, I could have had a Premium+ A6, but the size would clearly differentiate them.  I had not (and mostly still don't) considered the possibility of an A3 or CLA or ILX ever being considered for entry into the ELLPS class -- because of my [possibly wrongheaded] assertion that as nice (or expensive) as the [top o' the line] A3 family (which is called an S3) is, well, it is smaller than the already EL entrant, the A4.  Just as we bumped the CTS to the LPS class and replaced the then ELLPS CTS with the ATS, we may -- soon -- find ourselves needing to do the same thing with the ILX and A3.  Today, however, knowing only what is out there, it doesn't seem [to me] right to have both the ILX and the TLX called ELLPS cars -- just like it doesn't seem right to bracket the CLA and C Class Mercedes as ELLPS cars.  It seems that base price is the hang up -- not actual price -- for we don't seem to argue that a 5 series is an ELLPS anymore than we would argue an A6 or E class is an ELLPS -- we don't because there are model designations downstream (in both size and price).  We have (or the manufacturers have) blurred the lines somewhat -- and it will be another cycle before the cars are again (maybe) rationalized.  An ILX is an Acura. An ILX is a tarted up Honda A TLX has much more L + P than the ILX There is a car model, not just a badge, below the TLX -- and that is the ILX.  Currently the same breakdown is applicable to the A3 and A4 -- but the new A4 will what? Blur the lines further or sharpen the focus, make the two more readily differentiated? Does anyone think the CTS and ATS are the same class of car -- even though the MSRP of the ATS can be made to significantly overlap the MSRP of the CTS.  And so on.  I'll settle -- internally -- for the TLX to be in the same class as the A4, 3 series and C class. I'll accept the A3 and ILX and CLA as similar classified cars. I just find it difficult to have both the A3 and A4 designated as ELLPS cars if the 3 series is in the mix -- the 3 series is marketed against the A4 and C class, not the A3 and ILX class.  I'm more willing to overlook driven wheels -- but my own money would only go for an AWD vehicle knowing what I know and living in the climate I live in. This rules the ILX out -- but keeps the TLX SH-AWD firmly in the fold.  This is getting difficult for me to keep straight.  I love these forums, and I do not want to exclude anyone from them -- but for the sake of birds of a feather, so to speak, when I want to get into one of the forums, I'm not going to venture into the full-sized pickup truck forum since my interests are probably not going to be well served there (and vice versa).  I want to hear (read) your thoughts pertaining to similar vehicles -- I'm going to gravitate toward forums where the participants are interested in and experienced with 3 series, C class, B8 Audis (A4's), TLX's Q50's, etc, etc. I don't have interest in Malibus (not that there is anything wrong with them or those who write about them) or LaCrosses or 300's or 911's or Stingrays (same). Yes a fully tarted up S3 may give rise to a legitimate question about S3's vs A4's or S4's, but generally speaking these are meant to be separate models within the Audi family.  Besides, Audi will soon be rolling out the B9 A4's which will, probably, crank up both the L and the P (and the price) further differentiating the A3 and A4 lines. Mercedes, BMW, Acura, Lexus and Infiniti will almost certainly do the same thing. Well, I think Mercedes already has with the new C class compared to the new CLA class.  In any case, there needs to be a place to go to discuss the cars that would appear to be competitive with each other. Yes, I guess it is possible for someone to shop for an ILX and drive out with a TLX SH-AWD Advance, just as it is possible to look at a 328 and drive out with a 335ix -- but, using the auto magazine comparison test reports as guides, it would be more typical for the A4 to be tested against the 3 series or the C class not the A3 tested against the C class and 3 series, etc.  My head hurts.",round along dont p feather audis im meaning auto competitive wrongheaded almost nissan styling give bumped forum going money thought differentiate vice geaudiing exclude doesnt petite mercedesss another cost line performance audi ever test trouble 32k subaru even interests forums mercedes new anything hang want rationalized toward look coming thoughts comparison difficult case differentiated el guess mind would sake speak cars needing ill go beaudier like sharpen legitimate tarted c size historically brands head premium came acuraxs harbor badge driven purposes possibility lps needs stingrays msrp pertaining base l write lexus nice blur pickup drive regular possibly entrant cycle family setacurae two guides discuss readily 70k argue version since well 5 climate speaking series lines pre infiniti bmwix living internally bracket already smaller cts car called 911s mercedesssified clearly crank within ford advance accept kicking screaming interested indication separate acurax tested brand marketed applicable similar rise typical birds seem maintenanced yes much fit certainly mix range slim made dropped hear expensive someone bmw rolling love rules experienced make significanacuray buicks place top designated e though today notion hell extent vehicle read firmly downstream overlap considered somewhat get price sort mosacuray certain assertion probably nissanion 300s magazine gravitate thing anymore entry straight chevrolets ellps audi0s think subjective trait truck possible could blurred knowing keep meant wrong soon generally breakdown manufacturers fold keeps know sperformanceerformance still however compared maybe close venture served right willing cadillac reports vs shop whole 87k honda may besides appear anyone differentiating seems finally overlook participants example fullsized live actual etc find designations acura interest darned one vehicles currenacuray hurts using fully

3076,"March 23, 2015 11:29PM",markcincinnati,"Perhaps these cars that we talk about that are in this broad broad category should be called Compact LPS, but also it might make sense to call them mid-size? Entry level and the LP designation if price is the current meaning of EL would seem to be an oxymoron -- and, if price is the meaning of EL, today, where do A3's, to name one, go? Do we ""rationalize"" the naming according to price? The Audi lineup (to name the one I am most familiar with) is A3 (and Q3), A4/A5 (and Q5), A6/A7 (and Q7). The characteristics of these that stands out first is size -- and as the cars get larger, in the progression the price does indeed escalate. But, prior to the current A3, the Audi A4/A5/S4/S5/RS5 were the ""entry level"" cars in the line. They were of a common, more or less, wheelbase length and the other notable characteristics that shared the theme were length and width -- size.  The part that conveys the cost factor is the amount of the content of Land P and a ""certain something"" that somehow we all understand, but like the word ""quality"" is a bit more difficult to define. A Chevy with a 110"" wheelbase is not a member of the ELLPS club. A BMW 3 series, no matter how tarted up or down, however, is.

This, then, means we still have to have some way to account for the ""L"" and ""P"" of the cars (and of course the L+P add both content and cost, even to the base).  Perhaps we can then say that a base 3 series and a fully-optioned 335 are both ELLPS cars because they both start out at a price point of $X.  My car, today, is at the Audi dealer for its 25,000 service interval. Since the dealer has a policy of ""trying"" to match the loaner they provide with the car in for service, I was provided with an S4 for the day. The thing has 1,800 miles on it and is Misano Red Pearl in color (this color is a $500 option); the car also has the B&O sound system upgrade and blind spot monitoring. As a loaner, it also happens to be one equipped with the S-tronic (dual clutch) automatic transmission.  I consider this car below what I would think almost anyone, today, would go for -- but the dealer general manager says no, this car is EXACTLY the base model from a practical perspective, because ""they can't sell"" a version without some level of equipment above ""book"" entry level (what I would call a true stippie).  Indeed, since the car does not have MMI, it will probably only sell because it will -- eventually -- come out of the loaner fleet and be subject to very heavy off MSRP discounting. The ""on the lot"" cars virtually all have MMI+, those that don't were probably ordered specifically without nav with the dealer knowing they would end up in the loaner fleet.  You may or may not chafe at the nearly $3,500 price tag for the MMI+ system, but the take up of that option is, apparently, nearly universal, as is S-Tronic. Yet, sitting on the showroom floor there are a couple of A4's (and one of them, too, is nav-less); I would argue that the base price of these Junior-LPS cars is rarely seen by the actual buyers, since most folks do, typically, go for the ""popular"" option group.  I must note, too, that one reason for the majority going with the popular option groups and/or packages is that the lease calculations FAVOR the high-content variants over the maxed out variants and the strippie variants. Some car-actuary has figured out what will retain the highest residual -- and that, these days, is medium to medium high loaded.  So, if price, not size, is to be the rule of the day, I would have to submit that the price range of cars that fit the bill of ELLPS must be on the order of $39,999 to $69,999; after all it is possible to start out with a BMW 328 ""Walmart"" (or TJ Max) version and max out at a 335ix ""Bespoke"" (so to speak) and spend tens of thousands crossing the chasm from pauper to prince.",strippie point inclusion content performance perspective think discounting p dont retain interval virtually stippie walmart consider modifications 25000 chafe typically blind maintenance variants max say system account possible 1800 specifically equipped take pauper fullyoptioned consoleless knowing bo almost subject folks nomenmercedesture exacacuray dealer styling thousands bespoke fleet day 39999 mmi groups high brand consoleing equipment uninissanl going loaner indeed practical sell included msrp reason x still juniorlps happens true fit tj mercedesss mix highest base range cost clutch assume l couple packages residual match trying audi provide spot must book loaded provided rarely even start maxed bmw policy sound without lease rule order call medium showcomfort determining yet heavy pricepoint note lp come prince tag popular may performance add caractuary ordered today argue siaudiing favor whatever dual version tens anyone since 69999 perhaps would price bill end buyers chasm options calculations spend figured speak seen cant days 3500 way course safetyly manager probably cars actual highcontent general group bmwix 500 miles option stronic go lot red andor pearl eventually says factor one submit misano upgrade level also thing based car entry majority console size nearly means floor crossing ellps apparenacuray

So, unless we disregard naming convention and not recognize 4-series as a separate model, we would have to be prepared for another price escalation. Also C400 is already above $45K.  Based on a quick look, it seems the top versions of those Germans are pricing themselves out of this segment: S4 starts at $48K, S5 is $52K, C400 sedan is $48K, I'm sure the next generation coupe will me more. It's almost like there is forming a separate segment of ""entry level plus luxury sports sedans"", however oxymoronic it sounds, slotting itself in high 40s/low 50s base pricing, with options running up to $70K. One could add R-Design trim of Volvo S60 and ATS 3.6. One could easily make an argument for adding IS350 F and some may want to add top TLX, but I don't know about that. This segment would be distinguished by elevated performance bolted on essentially the same frame of their basic versions. Some additional differentiations by unique colors, interior versions, or other aesthetic treatments will separate those trims further.  Then M3/4 and RS4/5 with (future C AMG) could be called ""high performance compact luxury sports sedans"". ATS-V, if finally released, will surely be aspiring to that club. This segment will mean not only separate special engines, but special solutions related to suspension, weight reduction, chassis design modifications made specifically to support the performance.

Basically, any given version of those original brand cars has to lose one of the letters. Their true sports luxury versions are no longer entry level, as they cost easily over $50K, sometimes even $60K, their ""entry sports"" versions lack some features found in $15K Kia or Hyundai, which makes one wonder about the luxury part.

3124,"March 23, 2015  6:55PM",roadburner,"Since the weather has improved I've been driving the 2002 and 318ti on a more regular basis. For me it is interesting and fun to experience the entry level Bimmers of 40 and 20 years ago.  My first BMW was a 1973 Bavaria 3.0 that my girlfriend-now wife of 29 years-found for me back in 1983, so when I bought the '02 by accident(long story) on eBay in 2008 it really was like going home again. The 2002 is lightweight yet feels solid; all the controls are reasonably direct and the 2 liter four does it's best- but with only 100 bhp it can only do so much. Aside from an Alpine AM/FM/CD?Sirius XM head unit all the modifications on my car are period correct-E21 Recaros, Weber 32/36, Delta CD ignition, Bosch Red Coil, Bilstein HDs-so the original character of the car shines through. Even with a direct top gear it easily cruises at 80+. Grip is good but body roll can be unsettling to those used to modern levels of roll stiffness. Still, I could easily see myself using a 1973 tii(with a five speed retrofit, rotary A/C compressor, and a decent head unit/speakers) as a daily driver. No, an E10 is most definitely not for everyone, but for those it speaks to, it is a revelation.  I consider the E36/5 ti to be ""The Last '02"" since it was the final BMW four seat coupe fitted with a semi-trailing arm suspension and a naturally aspirated four cylinder. Unlike the 2002, the ti is much more suitable to use as an entertaining(and economical) daily driver. It has a great HVAC system, adequate power(with a Turner/Conforti chip, at any rate), ABS, and front airbags. The only things I really miss(besides 100 extra bhp) are heated seats and wheel mounted audio controls. It weighs in some 550 pounds less than a 228i- and is 10 inches shorter. When BMW Individual was building my Club Sports they tried to make me take the ""optional"" sunroof but my salesperson stepped up and thus my car was built without a hole in the roof. For me, the car is just about perfect; light, nimble, and a ball to drive. The M42 engine does not suffer lazy driving; if you don't like keeping an engine ""on the boil"" than this definitely isn't your car. And on a winding road what shines through is the car's lack of mass. I've been reading how Mazda's new Miata will weigh close to what a 1994 Miata weighed. It would be nice if BMW started making weight reduction more of a priority. Speaking of vehicle weight, did you know that US safety standards require that the front airbags, side curtain airbags, and interior be designed to protect an unbelted 160 pound male? That's ridiculous, every state has a mandatory seat belt law, so safety systems should be engineered to protect properly restrained occupants. I'd think that would allow a significant reduction in weight and complexity. And anyway, at some point we need to let the Law of Natural Selection take its course.",id ive decent rate optional dont amfmconsolesirius ridiculous system let inches direct retrofit going bmw2 really chip girlfriendnow need belt weighed story controls rotary semitrailing mandatory even grip new hdsso significant e10 suffer first keeping shines would miata properly ac weight things law bimmers cars yearsfound entertainingand mazda 29 228i red like 3236 safety thcadillac bosch console feels point improved ebay consider modifications tiiwith salesperson heated selection unbelted take head styling bilstein character gear restrained levels systems designed making coupe 1983 missbesides 10 light nice performances drive regular mass recaros arm five less turnerconforti allow years nimercedesle protect weber ignition revelation performancewith stiffness definitely since solid unsetacuraing body tried speaking isnt alpine 550 course state lazy use delta car male driving 100 wife front weighs bought reasonably compressor see perfect side easily performanceered much winding ti liter club reduction bmw 80 cruises economical last final unitspeakers safetyty shorter priority 318ti make period top hvac 1994 hole us four bavaria naturally vehicle suitable curtain xm bmw5 accidenacuraong styling pound 160 2008 aspiration weigh comfort modern speaks home fiaudied original lack 1973 adequate individual driver complexusty reading entry console think started comfort stepped 02 could roll road secadillac extra great natural every coil abs 40 2002 interesting performance back know still performance thus boil anyway building basis close performance pounds good mounted without daily aside yet bperformance roof lightweight unit occupants used aspirated built fun 30 performance everyone require standards ago experience 20 weather level correcte21 ball 2 unlike using

3126,"March 23, 2015  7:22PM",markcincinnati,"$45K UPPER limit for ELLPS? I would think that the number $45 is closer to the lower limit. If we're going to say that the car should have a STARTING price of $X, well there are a lot of cars that virtually no one buys that do indeed start at $38,995, but typically go out the door at least at $5K-$8K more.  I would think we're talking about a particular family of vehicles and that if we really mean LPS (as part of the acronym ELLPS), well you are indeed speaking of the entire family of 3 series from the lowest MSRP version (totally stripped, but, virtually never sold that way) all the way to the fully loaded M3. Where else would you put the M3 if not ELLPS? And, for that matter where would you put the ""typical"" 335 if not ELLPS, it certainly isn't going to fit in with the LPS cars (where the 5 series family inhabits).  $45K - $65K does cover about the widest range for all the cars that are generally considered in the ELLPS family. The thing that seems likely to make the number beginning with the ""$4"" as the bottom line number is the inclusion of the L & P, there are plenty of ""S"" (sedans) out there that can be had for $45K at the upper limit, but they are generally not going to be invited into the ""LP"" club. I would assume that Cadillac actually would begrudge a Regal (a Regal GS) the key to the ELLPS washroom, if the comparison is between the Regal and the ATS. Cadillac probably wants the ATS (all variants) in the ELLPS class and the CTS in the LPS class these days. Buick, based on the test reports of the LSS (Luxury Sport Sedan) Regal GS (starting at $40,195), I would think the Regal ""family"" can probably qualify. Where it becomes a bit dicey is that the bottom of the line model probably would be considered to be quite a bit less full of the ""P"" and the ""S"" of the bottom of the line ATS. And the middle child ATS can easily swim upstream to an MSRP of $55K+ without breaking a sweat.  The point, to repeat, is that the EL apparently seems, more than anything else, to represent the size of the vehicle; but the LP seems to classify the vehicle based on both luxury content and performance abilities.

3131,"March 23, 2015  8:57PM",markcincinnati,"My buddy has a very nice, well equipped BMW 5 series (circa 2003). It is probably equal to or maybe even a tiny bit smaller than a current 3 series.  Where do the ""more expensive"" versions of a model go if not here -- a 335 or an S4 are certainly very very similar, dimension wise to the 3XX and A4 variant from whose loins they sprung, eh?  EL is, today, a size or internal designation (not price); LPS indicates Luxury (which adds cost and sometimes great cost) and Performance (which adds costs and sometimes ooober cost). I cross shopped an A4 Prestige with most options with an S4 Premium+ with three options, because they were ""within reach"" of each other financially. I did not cross shop a maxed out A4 Sline with an RS5 (sorry there is no RS4), but had there been one to choose from, I presume I would still have considered the RS4 as an ELLPS since there is no way someone would confuse it with an A6, S6 or RS6 (or RS7 in the case of this line, since the RS6 isn't imported to the US).  The sales rep I deal with told me he had ""quite a lot"" of S4's coming off lease (that would be the ones prior to the V6 supercharged version, i.e, V8's) and that a number of these customers just couldn't fathom getting an A5 class without a V8, so they went with an RS5 rather than sticking with an S5.  In this class of cars, I think folks look at the size of the vehicle and determine if ""this is the size car I see myself driving"", then they begin with packages, options and accessories until they have the car customized to their liking.  A fully optioned A4 2.0T Prestige with optional features is very close in price to a somewhat less decked out S4, hence my consideration of both. I assume BMW shoppers do the same thing -- they go in for the 328 and trick one out with the option sheet and then test drive a 335 with a few less options and say, ""I'm going to stick with the EL (size) but forego a bit of L for a dose of P in my 3 series Sedan. Happens all the time.  My wife -- set on a Q5 3.0T Premium Plus with about 4 additional options -- test drove an SQ5.  Katie, bar the door -- the 3.0T was super nice -- but the Performance of the SQ was intoxicating.  She did not, however, cross shop with a Q7 or a Q3 -- she wanted the size first, performance second and luxury third. Some folks probably switch second and third -- but there is a cost regardless.  Know too, that some folks (my wife included) checked out the Q5 2.0T first and was ""this close"" to the buy, until she test drove the 3.0T and was ""this close"" until she test drove the SQ, and so it goes.

Ambitious Lexus is breathing down the neck of Mercedes-Benz in a bid to regain the top spot it hasn't held since 2010. Through February, Lexus sales have jumped 26 percent, passing BMW to move into second place behind Mercedes. Like its rivals, Lexus is basing its growth on an aggressive product offensive....

3257,"March  9, 2015 11:33PM",markcincinnati,"White is the new black. According to our BMW store white is the most popular color. Black and silver are also popular.  White and gloss black are often the only two ""free"" paint colors offered by European mfgrs. My wife pulled the trigger on a $1,075 paint color called Panther Black -- yes it is purty, but that just seems like way too much for what appears BLACK from a distance of over 10 feet.  I used to special order Pearl White on all my Audis. Then, one year, the price jumped from $500 to $2,500 and Pearl White became a member of the Special Order collection that Audi offers to anyone who will pony up the money. It is called Audi exclusive -- hell yes it is exclusive, because anything you order -- ANYTHING -- starts at $2,500 -- why? Because they can.  In 2009, I wanted the Ecru (Cardamom) interior color and it only came with blonde wood -- I thought the contrast wasn't there, I wanted the burl walnut wood inlays. At that time, $2,000. Despite the fact that I had custom ordered the A4 Pretige with most every option listed, I just couldn't bring myself to pay $2K for something that was no charge had I not wanted the Cardamom leather. Next year blonde was dropped in favor of the dark walnut.  Much as I favor an almost the sky's the limit, I just can't see something like I have just described as anything other than an option from our ""shameless profit collection.""  BMW seems to charge breathtaking prices for wheels that aren't part of the two or three ""normal"" choices offered -- I know there are certainly differences that justify higher costs, but there was an X6 on the showroom floor with a $5,000 wheel package (tires were another upcharge).  I know a lot of options are outrageously priced, but at least it would seem they kind of bury the charge so that the price gouging isn't obvious.  Now I'll show my ignorance -- the last time I priced an Infiniti, their color palate was ""included"" in the MSRP base. This included both pearl and just clearcoat colors.  I'm the guy who would probably pay MORE for the basic car if all the paint choices were ""included"" -- it just galls me to see $1,075 for an admittedly pretty black color.

3270,"March 10, 2015 11:18PM",markcincinnati," The problem I have with the statement would entirely go away if the words between the parenthesis had not been part of the declaration.  Furthermore, my issue with most of these cars -- but the Germans top the list of offenders -- rears its head because I typically select the top option package and then add individual options on top of that.  A base (good luck finding one) Audi S4 is hard to beat -- but I wouldn't have one unless it had, navigation, B&O sound system, blind spot monitoring . . . and the list goes on. There is no way the technology we (or I) love, voice-activated navigation + bluetooth, etc, is worth $3,500. Hell, I can buy a 75"" Samsung HDTV for about $500 less than that, and that price is dropping 2% per month.  So, yeah, there are very good cars at attractive price points -- we can argue if this or that is BETTER than a BMW or an Audi or a Mercedes, etc, but there are a lot of comparable cars IF POPULARLY equipped. My car has almost $10,000 worth of options on it, and I didn't even get a Prestige model.  The base fill in the blank German fill in the blank is likely to drive, perform and ride better than the ""other guy"" -- but the heck of it is, the German car will be a strippie and the other guy will come chock full of features that just seem out of touch with even a generous gross margin.  Now, having said that, I will prove myself a walking and driving contradiction. I do, to this very day, believe that the Acura TLX SH-AWD with the Advance package (and ONLY that configuration) is Acura's S4. And, it is really damn near impossible to find one that rings up a $50,000 tab. Yet, if you drive the two cars, back to back, well there is that certain something (that my wife calls soul) that the Acura doesn't even seem to attempt to imitate. But the TLX's numbers are, for the bucks, impressive.  So, I complain about the price of the S4 vs the TLX (which makes a good case for itself as being in the same league), but I still put down the extra $6K-$12K for the Audi BECAUSE I test drove it.

3272,"March 11, 2015  1:31AM",markcincinnati," At the risk of getting myself in hot water: NONE, since we now have numerous examples regarding performance -- stating that overall, the automatic transmission especially one with dual clutches is generally speaking (for those of us mere mortal consumers) superior AND preferred by a huge number of regular consumers. Only if enough folks spend the money and actually buy a manual transmission car, will they even be available too much longer. Automatic transmissions today improve the performance (or at least the perception of performance) of many, if not most, of the cars they are marketed with.  And, in terms of the utilization and circumstances of use by the majority of consumers (again for mere mortals), AWD no longer needs to have any apologies made for it or by it, other than to say, ""excuse me"" as the AWD version passes the RWD or FWD version. Ask Porsche, to name one, what cars they market are AWD -- the low performance or high performance variants?  I can appreciate RWD and manual transmissions -- but they're not, for the buyers that keep these ELLPS car mfgs alive and well, where the ""performance"" buyers gravitate towards.  The reasons are well documented and even if I did think RWD and manual transmissions were any more than an entry in the bibliography of a glitzy brochure (if brochures actually had bibliographies), the shoppers, buyers and actual consumers believe and behave differently (based on their spending, at least); that is auto trans cars rule and AWD is in very widespread use, often in the cars touted as THE highest performance versions.  The sooner we start recognizing that these companies that build the machines we covet probably don't care one way or another what wheels are driven and how the thing is shifted, the better, because they care overwhelmingly what will facilitate the goals of corporate survival, growth and prosperity. I would assume if BMW thought it could overwhelm Audi by building and selling FWD cars exclusively with manual transmissions, I would assume they would do so.  A dead purist is still dead, after all. Companies are no different -- the auto transmission has or is close to defeating stick shifts; turbo or super or both engines of 4 or 6 cylinders are replacing displacement based engines as each day passes and AWD cars or at least the option to add AWD is well on its way toward total market dominance.  I like being alive -- but, in my case at least, I actually think auto trans AWD vehicles are the best most of us mere mortals can get today.

But, today's automatics are SO GOOD, I don't know of anyone who can actually putperform one with a manual. Tough to find any manual transmission cars, anywhere, regardless of price. Yes, you can special order them. But, dealers know if they stock them, it's a long road ahead trying to find a customer who knows how to drive one, let alone, finding someone who wants one. They're out there. They're a acarcity, though.  Even something like a Mustang GT or Camaro SS are tough to find in a manual trans. They're a bit more plentiful, but you have to search some to locale them.  I think most of the trade rags give the nod to the Cadillac ATS when it comes to 3 Series, A4 etc comparisons. I've driven an ATS, several times. They are a very fun car to drive that can rock and roll with anything in its price range. Good looking and built well with great materials, too.  I agree with Mark....on the upper end of the ELLPS range, probably the S4 could arguably be preferred over the others. Audi, at least in my exeperience (and some others here at Edmunds) aren't exactly the poster children for reliability, nor are they reasonably budget friendly to keep and operate. Still, can't argue its performance.  Acura TL SH AWD Advance? Boy....I would have a hard time justifying $50K-$60K for a 3xx ix or A/S4, C300/400 4 Matic if I were looking for a level of performance, comfort, build quality, cheap to own and operate for what I paid for mine ($38K and change). I don't have enough seat time in the TLX SH AWD to really render a judgement. But, for $45K list for the advance package, the same applies to it.  If it weren't just a wee bit tight for my tastes, I would have had a Lexus is350 F sport gracing the GG estate right now. It's a lot like the Acura TL. It doesn't lead in one category, but is really good in ALL categories. At the time, I could have plucked one up, fairly loaded for $46-$47K, too. It's design could be polarizing, too. But again, being the ""odd ball"" I am, likeing the TL's previous design, I liked the Lexus' design, too.  I understand people being polarized by the styling. But, no one can deny their trouble free nature, longevity, sport sedan handling and frugality when it comes to operation and maintenance. They are a LOT of car for that kind of money.  So, are their better cars out there than the 3 Series? From my perspective, yes....lots of them. My reasons may be different than yours, though.

3278,"March 11, 2015  3:24PM",markcincinnati,"In·ev·i·ta·ble: unable to be avoided, evaded, or escaped; certain; sure to happen.  Our sometimes heated discussions about the merits of manual transmissions vs. automatics or about RWD, FWD, AWD, etc. are – or will pretty soon be – irrelevant. These discussions may be entertaining, they may even be cathartic, but there is plenty of evidence of the inevitability of semi-autonomous and ultimately autonomous cars.  With google, Apple and many others you’ve never even heard of working on technologies whose purpose it is to remove you from the driving equation, it is a matter of years – perhaps so few we could discuss the time frame in months (you know like a 60 month car-loan term) – before we essentially have “individual” mass transportation. By that I mean we’ll have individual containers (cars) that, as far as you’re concerned, provide you with about the same experience you have as when riding a bus, limo or train. You’ll have the flexibility that a private car offers and you’ll be, for the most part, nothing more than a passenger.  It probably doesn’t even matter if you want this technology or not, it’s coming. It’s coming pretty quickly too. Insurance and many other private companies, federal, state and local governments want it. You’ve (or perhaps, better said, “we’ve”) proven we’re not capable, or perhaps it is just that we’re not willing to prevent the inevitable. Just this morning, coming into work, I passed a driver of a late model Mercedes S class – the driver was on the phone! There is no way this Mercedes doesn’t come standard with hands-free, eyes-free, voice activated Bluetooth connectivity and control; yet, there was this bozo with one hand on the road, in rush-hour traffic, with the phone held up to his ear. Now, how does that make me make the leap to autonomous cars?  Well, as I am willing to say, I am often wrong, but never uncertain, we might simply mandate built in jammers that prevent cell phone usage in a moving car. But, think about it, what we really want is for the driver to not use a hand-held phone while driving. We probably don’t want to prohibit passengers from using a cell phone. Even my Audi offers in-car Wi-Fi, so it seems that we’re moving in the direction of greater, not restricted, connectivity. So what do “we” do? Rather than taking away the ability for the driver to use a hand-held phone, we’ll just go ahead and take away the ability to drive the car altogether because we have demonstrated that distracted driving is sometimes actually worse than drunk driving – and if you bother to look, you’ll find there are a lot of drivers using hand-held phones. This is all the more frustrating (for me at least) since I know that an ever increasing number of cars have Bluetooth as standard equipment.  Inevitable? Yes. While growing up, my parent’s cars never had seatbelts – in 1963 my dad bought a brand new Chrysler Newport. It did not come with seatbelts. The dealer, however, did put them in the car (2 in the front seat only). I never knew if this was in response to a government mandate or if it was part of a promotion. As time passed we graduated to cars that came with 3 seatbelts in the front (unless you had bucket seats), then rear seatbelts, then shoulder belts then seatbelt interlocks that essentially attempted to force seatbelt use as the cars would not start unless the seatbelts were fastened (leading to folks fastening their seatbelts, then sitting on them, therefore defeating the purpose.)  We can, in the name of safety, list all of the inevitable features that have been added since 1963 – actually, we could have another list of all of the features added in the name of safety before 1963. These two lists, with descriptions, would fill volumes.  These days, any manufacturer who wants to, can crank out a 300HP motor and put it in a lightweight body. And they can do so for what is (for someone my age) an almost unbelievably low price. Even 350HP, 400HP or 500HP are pretty much within the engineering talents of just about any name brand auto manufacturer. Likewise, 6,7,8,9 and 10 speed automatics, some with dual clutches and torque converters (in the same transmission) further multiply many car’s accelerative capabilities sometimes stretching the limits of the short-attention span humans we’ve seen increasing on the planet at an alarming rate. When 0-60MPH can happen in less than 6 seconds and when, at 60MPH, you’re overtaking anything not moving at a rate of 88 feet per second, it’s no wonder untrained and distracted drivers crash and burn.  The response? Intervention. Police intervention? Sure, but often that is after it is too late. What is, apparently, better is for the car to intervene on the driver’s behalf. First came four-wheel brakes, eventually disc brakes, then anti-locking brakes, then electronic stability programs, then radar/sonar pre-sense systems, cameras and more cameras, lane warning systems, lane keeping systems, systems meant to keep you awake, systems that can bring a car to a full-stop and maintain assured clear distances at highway speeds approaching triple digits. Then there are the slow speed crash avoidance systems, pedestrian safe-keeping systems, night vision systems, automatic mirrors and automatically deployed headlight beams that dim whenever approaching traffic is detected. Infiniti, despite much negative press, even disconnected the steering wheel from the steered wheels altogether as they designed – perhaps intentionally, who knows – a semi-autonomous car, the Q50. Google has demonstrated their autonomous driving handiwork, too, in a Mercedes S-class; and recently an Audi A7 (or so it appeared to be) navigated, at speed, the Nürburgring. Look ma, no hands!  Recently, I have, with humorous intent, invoked the quote from Pogo, “We’ve met the enemy and he is us.” Now, without mirth, I re-invoke the saying and once again, I blame you (all of us, really) for not learning how to drive, not learning safety and performance driving. I blame us, as a culture, as a species, for not making the requirements for getting an automobile driving license perhaps nearly as rigorous as the requirements to get a private airplane pilot’s license.  If we all had to know how to drive defensively – and prove it – we could, perhaps, forestall the inevitable autonomous automobiles currently picking up speed in the pipeline to a retailer near you. Yes, forestall, not prevent, because eventually, even great education won’t be enough, great engineering will prove inadequate and “traffic law” enforcement will always remain mostly an after-the-fact activity rather than robust preventative measures.  I – alone at my house, anyway – pretty much welcome autonomous cars, because driving on our I-275 with the apparently ignorant [great] majority of the population (and I include myself) is just too much Sturm und Drang (Storm and Stress). I have this wonderful 333HP sporty sedan and I drive it mostly in stop and go traffic, bumper-to-bumper (no matter how hard I try to maintain one car length for every 10MPH) and at about 47MPH (or less, truth be told). The hell of it is, I live in Cincinnati – have you ever been here? This place is barely a city for pity’s sake; it is so small, so relatively sparsely populated. I can only imagine the frustration of having an S4 in Chicago or Boston or Dallas.

I understand that she probably means something that is there but very difficult to quantify -- it can't be measured and written down, that is.  I did, mostly, enjoy my 2012 TL (most especially the audio system -- I still have the DVD-Audio discs), were I to even attempt to characterize what I could articulate differentiated the TL vs the S4, it would start with a sense that the Acura seemed ""flimsy,"" most notable when closing the doors. The Audi closes with a muted, solid whomph! sound, no clicking or other mechanical noises, the door closing almost seems hydraulic it is so smooth so ""of a billet of solid steel"" invoking. The Acura on the other hand, sounded a bit like an empty tin can being dropped from about 5 feet onto asphalt. The very comfortable, heated and ventilated seats, in the Acura also had a bit of ""play"" or give in them somewhat like a table at a bar that needs a folded pack of matches put under one of the legs to keep it from wobbling.

3284,"March 11, 2015  7:02PM",flightnurse," Mark, Audi does not built a RWD drive car that has a 50/50 weight distribution, neither does MB, Infiniti or Lexus. I agree that the automatics of today are just as good if not better. The 8 spd in my 320i with the coded Sport Transmission is a great unit, I can cruise in comfort and not feel it shift, or if I want to be sporty and hold the rev's longer, I push the toggle switch to Sport, and if I want to push it harder, I'll push the toggle switch again and the transmission goes into Sport+. Then the transmission shifts quicker, and will hold to redline until I move the shift down for a higher gear (320i's do not have paddle shifters from the factor, but can be added via the aftermarket for about $500.)  When people talk about the car in the past being better, this reminds me of when my EX and I had a couple of classic cars, he had a 57 Continental Mark II (Please do not call it a Lincoln Continental) and I had a 70 Olds 442 Convertible W30 and a 70 Mustang 302. The Olds was the classic A body car. Yes, it was fast but not really THAT fast, the Mustang was quick, faster then the Olds, but not as fast or quick or quick as cars in the late 90's, and lets talk comfort, the Olds was an Auto, the Mustang was a stick, the clutch on the stang was SOOOO stiff it was rough to drive it around town or smooth. The Continental rode like it was on clouds, smooth and elegant, but trying to stop 2.5 tons of car with drum brakes, was a feat... Even the Olds and stang had disk brakes up front they still didn't stop all that well. So when I hear people talk about the good ole days of cars and how good they are, I just laugh.. Give me a 335i with sport package, a car that is faster, smooth, handles better and is suited for the long haul over the older muscle cars.

I know that in our '07 Mazda 5 which is of course a microvan, in pure maneuverability it outshines my current TL by quite a bit - tighter turning circle, better steering feel as an example. I would expect the current Mazda 3 to do quite a bit better than that.  The ILX on paper is a little smaller. Given my TL experienc, I'm sure it would be reliable and might be more refined than the Mazda, which is a consideration. The ILX has more HP but less torque, so not sure how they will both feel.

In fact, the ILX and the 3 are within about an inch of each other in length and width.  The Mazda 3 with the 2.5 is rated by the epa at 32 mpg combined, which is a big jump from the 21 of your 2005 TL. But the ILX does pretty well at 29.

3304,"March  8, 2015  4:42PM",markcincinnati," When I was new to trips to Germany, I would take every opportunity my wife would permit to go into Audi dealerships. I did the same thing on one trip to Zurich. I kept noticing no inventory -- but sometimes quite a showroom.  One trip, I went to the new Audi dealership that is at the Munich airport -- I asked the rep why no inventory? He told me that almost all of the cars they sell are ordered. Almost every Audi (and BMW) that we've had since 1978 have been special order cars. I always thought if you're going to spend ($50K+ in today's $s) and will settle for your third color option and not getting the options you wanted, etc, there must be something wrong with your sense of money. Why pay that much for a car that you wouldn't ever special order, but you'll take it because you can pick it up on Monday?  The 10th (so they say) largest BMW dealer is here in Cincinnait. We have two Audi dealerships, two BMW, three Mercedes, two Porsche, etc etc, stores in our Big Town (almost a small city). I have, many times, attempted to find THE car I wanted in stock -- ""can't be done!"" My most recent Audi was $57+K and my wife's SQ5 was $65+K. At what level of income does one have to achieve in order to settle for a $60K car that is ""sitting on the lot?""  I wanted blind spot monitoring and red leather. I also wanted all-season OEM tires. My wife also wanted blind spot and red leather -- but she wanted metallic black, while I wanted white. I would've probably taken the metallic white Audi offers, but I was very specific in what I wanted as was she.  What I can't imagine is being willing to settle on in-stock inventory, unless the exact vehicle was available or unless the price was hugely discounted. I took my 2012 Acura TL with a black leather interior -- a color I said I would never have (it makes the inside of the car feel small, to me at least, plus it is hotter than hell in the summer and the black seats often fade and look cheap) -- because the price was steeply discounted. What was I thinking? That fugly interior may have contributed to my relatively short time with the thing.  So, here is the other ""benefit"" of ordering your car: it kind of feels like you get ""the new car joy"" twice, once when you order it and once a couple of months later when it comes in.  Ordered cars, too, generally cost less than ones from inventory. The reason? The dealer doesn't have to pay the interest on the cars while they sit in inventory -- the dealer has a customer the moment the car comes in. Floorplan costs for your ordered car are likely to be very low.  When I see one of those mega dealerships with a 150 car showroom and a huge (acres) lot -- one so big you have to be shuttled to the location of the car you're going to look at -- I assume someone has to pay for that, and I assume it will be the customers.  The tiny dealer can order the same car as the big guy -- so if you're looking for the best deal, well the dealer that is so big the TV commercials have to be shot from a helicopter, is the one to avoid.

My BMW dealer (Sweeney) is a little bit better than the other place as far as having stock that meets my wants closer. But still, it's a struggle to find exactly what I want.  As you noted, the two Audi stores are even worse. Mercedes dealers seem to be a bit better, but I'm not really a fan of their cars. So, outside of helping my sister buy one, and the cursory looks I give them when I'm shopping, I can't mention whether their stock situation is good or not.  I know whenever I've become frustrated with the selection when buying a BMW, my long time sales associate is more than willing to order something. I never have. But, depending on their cycle of ordering, he's said it takes between 4 to 6 weeks from ordering until I'd be picking it up.  I can see the allure for the dealership. No floor plan to pay. It's pretty much a guaranteed sale, getting exactly the car YOU want. And, price is agreed up front (or at least it should be).  I've been to one of the Porsche dealers.

3307,"March  9, 2015  3:31PM",dino001,"Why pay that much for a car that you wouldn't ever special order, but you'll take it because you can pick it up on Monday?  That's what I say. I think same principle applies even to much cheaper cars. Considering that they are often even bigger portion of buyer's income (i.e. price of Ford Focus is most likely higher percentage of their buyer's income than those buying new 3- or 5-series; not always, but more often than not).  I never understood American ""have to have it today"" culture. Ironically, the need for instant gratification, today considered a ""core American value"", is a far departure from thrift and patience were virtues preached by the first settlers, but that's another story. As I was saying many times before, part of my attraction of German brands to me is the real ability to get something that's in the catalogue. The salesmen never complain, never roll their eyes, or repeatedly attempt to sell you what's there here and now. I consider a single proposal acceptable, what I hate is a hard push against clearly expressed customer's wish. Many other brands have ""phantom"" configurations, options and packages that can be specified together as ""available"", but not really available - not just not in stock, but simply not possible to get, even with waiting. When ask, you get this blank stare, like you just arrived from another planet. Some dealers would pretend to take an order and then try to fit what they have in the pipeline. Two months later, you get a phone call: there is one coming, just your color and option X, but it has a sunroof that you didn't ask for, is that OK? I've seen that too many times.  My only beef with German brand dealers, is that there are some options that truly change the car's characteristics, but not available in stock. Case in point - BMW 3 and 4 series have this adaptive M-sport suspension, which may or may not be a good thing. It is the only way to get a sport suspension on their AWD models, where Sport and M-Sport lines are only decorative aesthetic options (as opposed to RWD models, where sport suspension is added). I'm still yet to see any car in stock with that option. So should I want an X-drive car (e.g. wagon or GT models comes only with that that), I'd like to know how that adaptive M-sport suspension would work, if it's worth that extra thousand bucks, or not. I can't. Well, I'll live, I guess.

3308,"March  9, 2015  3:39PM",dino001," I think that's the price we pay for much lower price point on those cars. As you may know, Europeans pay often more than double for the same vehicles. I checked it - literally my $46K MSRP wagon in 2013 would have been around $100K over there. At that level, volumes must be significantly lower, but the choices are much bigger. Rather than three engines, you get something like eight. Interior comes both bundled and unbundled, same thing with convenience and performance options. Our option sheet for a model is three-four pages, theirs are fifty-page books. We enjoy lower price at expense of choices, limited even further by dealers catering to our own instant culture. They can be very particular, what to buy, but they pay for that privilege. To each their own, I guess.  BTW, there are similar market differences in electronics.

3313,"March  9, 2015  6:32PM",markcincinnati,"When we ordered my wife's two X3's we did order the sport seats, the sport steering wheel, etc -- we also got sport wheels with +1"" wheel size and wide and lower profile tires.  Two things struck me:  #1 if you get the package with the sport steering wheel, you can't have the wheel heated.  #2 no matter what ""sport"" option you selected, there was nothing that changed the calibration or ride height -- i.e., there was no sport suspension. The best you could do to sport the thing up was the bigger wheels and tires, which do help somewhat -- but the overall suspension is the same with or without the sport options.  Audi has a package they call ""SLine"" that is or was available -- and it did (on the A4 at least) offer sport seats, +size wheels and tires and lower ride height, stiffer springs, struts and thicker anti-roll bars (front and reat). Sometimes they even included a special steering wheel but they did include paddle shifters too when one ticked off the ""SLine"" option.  I see the A6, too, can be had with an all season or summer only sport package which does alter the suspension to ""sport"" calibration.  According to the special brochure, Audi's S cars have ""special S tuned"" suspensions which I believe our friends over on AudiWorld.com say is different from the sport package offered on the A4 and A6.  Why BMW chose NOT to offer a sport suspension on their X-drive cars is a mystery to me -- they surely must have the technical know how to engineer it, one would think.  Tires contribute to the cars handling, doh!, you already knew that. So, here is something you can do that you may find has value to you. When you order a new Audi S4 with the all-season tire option, it comes with 18"" wheels and 40 series tires. The optional tire package comes with 19"" wheels and 35 series tires.  The all-season tires are H rated grand touring Continentals or other Name Brand all-season tires. When you graduate to the 19"" wheels, the tires are Z rated (at least) and could be Continentals -- but they are MaxPerformance tires.  The difference, here in America, at least is that the Continental tires are ""good,"" but unless kept inflated to at least 42 pounds, they are built for comfort, not for performance. Why Audi chose H rated tires is beyond me.  When ordering the 19"", the tires are summer only rubber that helps the car go like a snake in a rat hole when compared with the H rated grand touring rubber.  So, what you can do, if you are an American who doesn't need or won't swap out tires twice per year, is go ahead and get the all seasons that come with the thing and upgrade (it is called +Zero) to a wider, lower profile Ultra high performance tire that will fit on the 18"" wheels -- or you can keep the same size tires but get UHP all-seasons. The difference is not subtle -- the car's willingness to turn in is cranked up to 11, it then really does go like a snake in a rat hole, and you won't be obliged to swap out your tires semi-annually.  Here's the deal, I THINK: European manufacturers, attempting to cater to American tastes, try to err on the side of comfort, quietness and durability beyond 25,000 miles. In doing so, I think they go too far. Why would Audi (for example) put H rated Grand-Touring tires on an ""S"" (not SLine) vehicle? I replaced ours with W rated UHP DWS Continentials (all season, Dry Wet, Snow), inflated the fronts to 43 and the rears to 41 -- transformation!  With virtual mass customization the norm these days, why not offer Grand Touring, All-Season Ultra High Performance and Summer only Maximun Performance tire options on the order form and be done with it?  Or at least think: BMW ""M"" is supposed to be more than an emblem or decal, more than trim and bling; likewise ""S"" (for Audi) is supposed to be a special version of a given Audi model, that includes sport: seats, exhaust, suspension, steering wheel and pedal covers, AND (one would think) TIRES. Somehow both Audi and BMW have an incomplete circuit somewhere that seems to prevent the inclusion of all of the required ingredients that go along with the notion of a ""sport model"" designation.

Sure, she wants good gas mileage and a reliable and durable car -- all wrapped up in a vehicle that meets her definition of ""soul."" Her SQ5 (and, truth be told, probably a Porsche Macan) dots all the ""i's"" etc. Her Infiniti FX35 -- a car that I thought was very capable, even though it lacked a 354HP supercharged engine -- was very well built, was reliable for nearly 60,000 miles (so I can't speak to its durability) and despite its thrashy engine note, was pretty much fun to drive (if you could stand 16MPGs). Yet, her Infiniti and my Acura TL pretty much made her run, not walk to the Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Mercedes, Porsche, Volvo and VW dealers to find a CUV -- a high performance CUV. The 300HP X3 was good, the Volvo XC60 Type-R was good, too, the Mercedes M class, VW Toureg and Cadillac SRX all had merit. We even tried the top o' the line Jeep Grand both with and without the Hemi. The MDX and RDX were also tested and quickly rejected.  When we got to the 3,0T Audi Q5 there was a glimmer of hope -- and there we were torn between the Q5 and X3 -- until we test drove the SQ5.

Yet, some here have spouses (or significant others) who are all about gas mileage or roominess for kids, dogs -- and all the stuff that goes along with kids and dogs.  And, the good news is, we're all right -- the SQ5 is the best car, just as the MDX or the TLX or the 535 or the ATS or A4 quattro or even the lowly Accord -- all of these vehicles are the best for ""your"" circumstances and situations.  When we get to the ELLPS and LPS class of cars, we are well beyond the basics -- we're into vehicles that are helping us in their own ways to self-actualize. That is what it is about -- finding the car that today will help you self-actualize. I'd add, if your spending on a new car doesn't help you even in some tiny way to self-actualize, you've NOT chosen wisely.  One of the car magazines (Automobile perhaps, hell, I dunno, I subscribe to all of them for pity's sake), has a phrase they use ""No Boring Cars."" I think as we enter one of the later decades of life, we do actually start to believe ""now is the time to eschew 'boring' cars"" (and other things, but this is the place for cars, NOT for other things); we decide we can differentiate between an Impala and a CTS, we can appreciate a Panamera (even if we decide not to spend that much on a car).  I've really enjoyed reading all the posts here (well mostly), for example the ones about the upcoming trip to Germany to pick up the new BMW, the good the bad and the ugly S4 issues, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, so to speak.  I do enjoy the many perspectives y'all bring to the party here. I love it when this forum is active -- even when time doesn't permit my participation.  We are, if you axe me, in the golden age of cars -- almost limitless choice and hardly a klinker in the bunch.  I now have 23,000+ miles on my '14 S4 -- today I lust for an S6, tomorrow I'll instead hope for a new, slightly larger S4 to be unveiled. All the while, I am impressed every time I get behind the wheel of my current car. Reading your posts about your adventures in car shopping (and some mis-adventures) is great fun, often informative and from time to time frustrating.  Sorry to get so sentimental, but this forum is really a terrific outlet for those of us car enthusiasts whose appetite is larger than our bank accounts.

Yes, the car actually goes where I want it to go (suspension seems to be responsive and compliant enough), but lack of the feedback is pretty significant for anybody who ever owned cars like Subaru WRX, or previous 3-series, especially like mine, with sport suspension.

3338,"March  5, 2015  2:12PM",graphicguy,"BEing a staunch Acura and BMW lover, I was as shocked as anyone when I found the CTS to be more engaging to drive than either.  My 3rd gen TL was good, but a bit darty on the road. Fun to drive, though. The 4th gen TL (Acura Shield grill) added to the previous gen in big doses. It was more sophosticated, suspension was much better, it was faster, smoother....just all around better.  The current TLX I need more seat time in. But, it seemed to regress a bit over the previous version. Yes, it had all the tech....LED lights, shift buttons, 9 speed trans, quieter, plus it hit a price point with the 4 cyl that will appeal to many. But,, I came away thinking I enjoyed my 4th gen TL drive better.  I do think RB is right. There are driving enthusiasts who do know what their car can do and the specs of just about every important function of the car.  Then, there are those who just don't care. They just want a BMW or a Mercedes. They know what they're buying before they get behind the wheel of the test drive. They wouldn't know the difference between understeer or torque steer if you held a fire to their feet.  Not saying any of that is bad. Just think the majority of sales by the likes of the German brands have little to do with how engaging their cars are to drive. It has more to do with the perception of themselves by owning one of those brands.  Benjamin....the thing with a TLX, you'll not find a car with more tech in it on the road. It handles well (4 cyl and SH AWD versions). It's relatively quick. And, once you drive it off the dealer's lot, the only things you'll be back for is oil changes and tire rotations for most of its life.

3339,"March  5, 2015  2:55PM",markcincinnati,"""We have met the enemy and he is us."" -- Pogo.  I agree with the following statement made here by one of our fellow posters:  ""The more you want to sell, the more you have to appeal to average Joe, even if Joe has more than average income.""  What I sense here, however, is that ""average Joe"" is meant to imply someone who, due to their lack of sophistication, and due to their sheer numbers has been at least partially responsible for the degradation of the ""essence"" of BMW automobiles (at least the 3 series apparently) ride and handling characteristics. Somehow I get the feeling here that I (we) am (are) meant to hold ""average Joe"" accountable and to blame for the sorry state of current BMWs steering and ride/handling characteristics.  What BMW did was realize, apparently, that it is better to be popular with respect to your target market rather than attempt to appeal to what some have called the lunatic fringe. If you are the CEO, what is your charge? I would argue it is to first retain market share then to gain market share. If your loudmouth customers won't put their money where their mouths are, do whatever it takes to find the customers and prospective customers who will.  Why is it so difficult, virtually impossible, these days, to find manual transmission cars? If you read what I read, you would think manuals are the best way to go if you want the best performance possible. Were I an auto manufacturer's CEO, and I read these posts and virtually all of the automotive enthusiasts magazines, I would start making stick shifts available all across my car lines. I would spend time and treasure to make certain my brand would offer stick shifts and that my dealers would be required to keep stick models in stock.  My company would suffer, because as Pogo says, ""the enemy is us"" [sic]. All of us loudmouths who want stick shifts (based on our bellyaching) were all yak and no shak! Stick shifts aren't popular, they don't sell and if I listened to the lunatic fringe, my car company would die on the vine.  Stiff suspensions and steering that offers road feel don't increase sales, in fact they must actually decrease sales or they would dominate.  It is possible to order an Audi A6 with a sport suspension, ultra low profile tires and 20"" wheels -- and those tires would be max performance designation and be made of short tread life summer only compounds. You would think the benefits of the lower stiffer suspension calibration thicker anti-roll bars and the above mentioned tires and wheels would be so obvious that dealers couldn't keep A6's so built in stock.  The reality is, the very few sport suspension equipped models are the slowest sellers. Pogo strikes again.  I say we all need to go out and BUY the 3 series all tarted up with every performance enhancing option possible, ditto the Audi, Cadillac and Mercedes (and other brands) models.  We need to shut up, grow up and pay up -- the cars you're (me too) bitchin' about are the way they are because of YOU. If you had forced the issue and actually put your money where your mouth is, well we'd have great performing BMWs (and the others, too) instead of the cars so many of us decry as ""not what they used to be.""

3342,"March  5, 2015  7:04PM",markcincinnati," OMG -- I am not in any way, shape, manner, form or regard suggesting (for REAL) that we shouldn't express our opinions. For pity's sake, I was ranting -- sometimes I just get worn out reading posts about how things were better then than they are now.  Sure it is possible that a product (and a car is a product) from 2000 or 1996 or even 2012 is superior in some way or many ways to a 2015 model. Overall, it is my belief that as time passes the products generally improve either by being more effective or more efficient or both.  The thing is, somebody writes (while obviously wringing their hands) how they're so very very disappointed in the (speaking of automobiles) fill-in-the-blank's appearance, engine, transmission, seats, sound system, nav system, fuel economy, wheels, tires, brakes, headlights, tail-lights, side-lights, and on and on and on until I could just scream.  If, for instance, you don't care for the Audi A4 2.0T (insert trim level and options here) because it has a 4-cylinder engine and a tinny sounding audio system and flat, non-supportive seats, well I would counter with either: Don't buy one or Option the thing up the way you want it including getting an S (and in some cases RS) model. Audi and BMW (again, to name just two) provide customers with extensive optional (or ""available"") configurations.  ""The 'old' 3-series was better?"" Better than what? I would argue you can option the 3-series to provide the looks (within reason), performance, handling, creature comforts, etc, that will allow you to have it your way.  Miss the i6 engine of yesteryear? Can't see yourself driving anything less than a vehicle with 6-cylinders? Get a 335. Better yet, get an M3 and stop being such a cry-baby. Me? I had to settle for an S4 with a 7-speed DSG transmission with a very nice B&O sound system and blind spot monitoring to say nothing of beautiful red leather seats. You'd think I'd gone daft were I to tell you my 1996 5-cylinder S6 was seriously a ""better"" car (even though it is a sentimental favorite).  Have to have a stick shift? -- well maybe you can maybe you can't get one in the particular fill-in-the-blank you want; but, as has been correctly noted above, today's dual clutch automatics and even torque converter equipped 8-speeds can and will out-shift Walter Röhrl on his best day -- do you think you can do better? (and besides the reason there are no stick shifts has already been explained and it is still YOUR fault).  The car you want in this era of virtual mass-customization probably does still exist. If you have to have analog steering with hydraulic assist, well, you'll probably have to buy a used car that may not have as many improvements as the 2015 or 2016 that you can buy off the lot, or better still order direct from BMW (or whoever).  Yes, yes, we should and hopefully will be permitted to continue, letting of steam: Wishin' and Hopin' for the good ol' days.  Gawd, some of us (and you know who you are) sound like my parents when I wanted to listen to the Beatles or Led Zep (or, heaven forbid, Pink Floyd): ""That's not music, its a bunch of barbarians, barbarians I tell you. Now Lawrence Welk, THAT's music Mark!""  If you (and you know who you are) just can't take the direction BMW is going, find something else and buy it. What I am concerned about (and often representative of) is our becoming a bunch of curmudgeons or maybe even Luddites.  Buying a 2005 fill-in-the-blank because that was the last year the arbitrary capillary was still used to keep the pressure evenly applied to the crank-knuckle, doesn't do anything for the advancement of the art and science of the automobile business (and we mustn't forget it is first and foremost a business).  All I am asking is that you (we) don't adopt my dad's approach to rock music in your descriptions of your disappointments with BMW or Audi or even Acura for abandoning us, the faithful -- dear old dad used to say this about rock music: ""Noise, Bohemian tripe, bang and twang over-loud, barbarians at the gates of hell!""

3346,"March  2, 2015  7:08PM",markcincinnati," I'm not sure folks buy BMW's so they can appear to be an enthusiast -- I'm pretty certain a lot of BMW shoppers (and ultimately buyers) aren't really all that aware, even, of BMW's reputation in that regard.  I would suggest that for some BMW's have the reputation as being ""the best"" -- so someone lusts for a BMW for a few years and then when that first ""big jump"" in comp or first ""big hit"" in an investment banking transaction that they were part of gives them that high five figure or six figure bonus comes along, well they go for ""the best"" which they think is a BMW.  My suspicion is that someone buys (or leases) a Porsche because it will make them appear to be an enthusiast, or, perhaps even more likely, they really ARE an enthusiast.  Or, and I hope this isn't really the case, someone buys that RS7 or 911 to suggest a certain size attribute of a body part. Or, the car is acquired simply to demonstrate the size of your check-book balance.  I read an article about people who seek speeding tickets so they can brag -- obtusely -- about their income, as in ""I can afford that [speeding ticket]."" That's inane -- maybe even insane.  Yesterday we were out and about in snowy Cincinnati -- only 4-wheel drive vehicles seemed to be venturing out -- I saw an A8L and my comment was, ""I don't care how much money we have, how big the bonus is, etc, don't ever get an A8 for me."" Sure the car suggests something about the owner's income -- but were I to think about spending inordinate sums of money to haul my skinny (or fat, as the case may be) butt around (mostly with no one else in the car with me), my choice would be an S6 -- pretty much the ultimate sleeper car if you axe me. Probably only a very few would even know of its somewhat lofty price tag, as a matter of fact. But that's just me. My friend buys A8's and never has any passengers in them -- I am so tempted to inquire if he has more money than sense. I just keep my mouth shut.

My wife and I attended a 2-day driving school in Spartanburg SC with a group of folks from all over the US and most of them owned both BMWs and non-BMWs and were very much car aficionados of the highest order.

The only thing I have ever seen, however, that even approaches the dweeby-ness you suggest is when someone at the Audi store asks me if my S4 (with the V6 T badge on it) has noticeable turbo-lag or some remark indicating they are unaware that Audis V6s are super, not turbo charged. I correct them, of course and they then ask me why Audi puts the ""T"" on both the super and turbo charged cars.  I give them the party line that is somewhat difficult to say with a straight face, we both shrug and I then tell them my S4 is both incredibly quick off the line and very fast thanks to the instantaneous response only a supercharged (or, granted, a naturally aspirated) engine can offer.

3351,"March  2, 2015 11:20PM",markcincinnati,"It amazes me how quickly KIA (and specifically the Genesis ""brand"" on the other side of the house) has (or is it have?) started to make the case that they, someday, may give the current Premium Class members a rude awakening. As you might imagine, being an Audi loudmouth for so many years, I do participate in my share of (apparently) Audi sponsored surveys.  I was surprised to see the number of questions some of these surveys contain that clearly indicate the Germans (or maybe it is just Audi, I dunno) are concerned that some Korean mfgrs are ""breathing down their necks.""  Now, I said that last bit for emphasis, but there has been at least a seed planted in the German mfgrs minds that says, ""The Koreans are Coming, The Koreans are Coming"" (and of course I immediately add -- mentally -- ""Cover yourself with butter and carry lemons just in case. . .!"")  But seriously, I saw some TV show on Velocity (I think) where a new Genesis (V8) was compared to a Mercedes E-Class and a Volvo S60. Now, at the time, before the video rolled, I thought, ""Whose dumbass idea was it to compare these three; they're not even close, no one would ever cross shop them?!""  Turns out I was wrong -- the Genesis, although not exactly a great handling car, has had its suspension tuned by Lotus (sorta) and the thing had a very powerful and smooooooth V8 hooked up to an 8-speed transmission (plus it had all of the latest and greatest electronic safety aids and toys the Germans keep loading their cars with.) Considering that this 2nd gen Genesis was in its first model year, I had to marvel at how far they've come and how fast they've done it.  I did think, too, Lexus was literally a trim-piece brand (and where are they now? First Place? or at least close to it) -- there weren't even any Lexi in Japan, they were all just called Toyotas. Now, look at Lexus -- a legitimate force to be reckoned with even if generally speaking some (OK most, OK, all) enthusiasts never have taken to them or seen them as anything more than sofas on wheels. Few, even the haters, laugh at Lexus now. And they actually brought that spunky little dude, the IS 350 F Sport to market and pantsed a BMW 335 (look it up, if you don't believe me.)  It would be hard to argue that both the top of the line Genesis, Equus and KIA cars aren't making ""don't look back, those headlights gaining on you are Korean"" type sounds.  So why isn't it possible for Acura to, likewise, kick butt and -- eventually -- regain some of its premium-ness? Of course, I don't KNOW, know, but I think, it is because they have found a niche where they have been and are successful, they make reliable and durable cars, their cars are in some pretty cool Marvel movies and the halo car has sex appeal. Have a cigar (and by the way, which one's Pink?)  By the way, I do think the NSX will be a great ambassador for the Acura brand, I just am not sure I see someone rushing in and buying an RLX based on the fact that the NSX wears an Acura badge. The gap between the NSX and the TLX or even RLX is unlikely to be narrowed by an oooober expensive sports car -- if you axe me.  Mean time, Genesis and KIA cars are quietly gaining ground and buzzing around the Premium Club members -- and you know what? Pretty soon one of them will sneak its way in and, then, well, there goes the neighborhood.  Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!  What next?

The enthusiastic owner is like the person who gets behind a basketball team once they go deep in the NCAA Tournament- but is unable to name any of the starting five, never mind what position they play. There automotive counterparts are the owners with V6 Beamers; they think a port installed LSD is an intravenous hallucinogen and absolutely adore the electronic oil level sensor- that way they don't have to remember how to open the hood..

3357,"March  3, 2015  7:03PM",markcincinnati,"Recently one (or more) of the ""big"" auto magazines (I think it was C&D) tested an old vs a new BMW. I assume the genesis of such a test was the ever growing brouhaha -- ostensibly from the faithful -- claiming the newer BMW's have lost some of their BMW-ness as BMW goes on the ""soich for more money!""  It seems, if memory serves, that the test reports demonstrated that the new BMW could better the old one in every significant (measurable) performance number.  Once again, since I am not, at this instant, in possession of the test report article, I could be mistaken. What I think I recall, however, is that despite the cries that BMW has forsaken the true believers, the numbers say otherwise.  I had been a die-hard manual transmission guy. Our Audis -- with the exception of my brand new 1997 A8 -- had always been manuals. My maxed out allroad (2003) had to be special ordered -- not that I probably wouldn't have anyway -- since the dealer simply did not stock stick shifts even back then. I couldn't believe Audi would simply no longer offer its cars with sticks (for the most part). The 2001 or 2002 A6 2.7T could be had with a stick but the same model with a 4.2 V8 was only offered with an automatic.  My wife's 2005 X3 had to be ordered, too, since there were virtually no X3's on the dealer's lot so equipped. As I recall we couldn't even test drive a stick BMW period.  When I got my 2005 A6, I knew I had probably enjoyed my last stick (the 2003 allroad 2.7T.)  Going on the hunt, I found that BMW did offer at least some stick shifts but there was little chance of finding one unless it was special ordered.  I now have a 7-speed DSG in my '14 S4. I, for the first time since 2003, don't miss the stick anymore.  Most people -- that I know, excluding my wife -- don't even know how to drive a stick, so I don't see much value in complaining about that, and, besides, the DSG is so much better at shifting than I ever was and the shifts don't feel like they're robbing power from the engine.  What we have today, if you believe Car & Driver (which I usually do), are better performing cars that have their performance characteristics available when you want them but invisible (for the most part) when you don't.  Yes, even Consumer Reports notes that an Audi [A6] is able to be sporty -- which I assume is somewhat of a statement that other brands (that they list) are not sporty.  I'm buying that today's fill in the blank (Audi, BMW, Mercedes & Porsche) automobiles are ""the best representations of sport sedans and CUV's ever on the market."" I'm, therefore, rejecting the notion that the old ones were better performers than the new ones. The fact that the brands have become more accessible to folks who don't think like I thought -- up until 2005 -- simply means the brands have the power to sustain themselves in the marketplace.  Even if I really thought a 10 or 12 year old M3 was somehow better than a new one, I am pleased that BMW has ""cast a wider net,"" for I fear had they not, they would be going or already have gone the way of the dodo.  The disdain so many have for sentimentality never ceases to amaze me -- my sentimental favorite car ever is my 1995 Audi S6 in pearl teal with a brilliant white leather interior. God I loved that car -- still have fond memories for it. It was, despite its being my favorite, no where near the car my 2014 S4 is -- the older S6 was, in perhaps every measurable way -- ""inferior"" to the new (or almost new) S4. My current S4 is the best car I have ever had, by a wide margin. I assume it would, in every measurable way, be crowned winna and champeen were it compared to the old S6 or even a last gen S4 (the one with the V8).  These cars that we talk about here and have strong opinions about are the best they have ever been (in every significant and measurable way). The fact that BMW or Audi now attracts folks who don't know that there isn't a V6 under the hood of their BMW is sad (for me at least); but, I would argue that the ignorant owner is just as desirable (as a customer) to BMW as the one who knows there is a turbo-charged inline-6 under the hood. In the end, car companies must put the soich for more money ahead of the soich for informed, appreciative and passionate customers. The way they go about selling more cars, however, is to build better cars that can be appreciated both by the true and pure disciples as well as the bourgeoisie.  Although I don't think the Koreans are TODAY too much of a threat to the world-order, I don't think we should dismiss them out of hand. They are making very rapid advances -- pretty soon they may find entry into the Premium Class (and by pretty soon I think we should be very watchful of the evolution of their products for the next 5 or so years.) I remember the first Toyotas that were imported (back in the 60's) -- made in Japan was, then, not much of a threat.

3359,"March  3, 2015  9:19PM",markcincinnati,"RB - No, The one I recall compared a new M3 to an old M3 (old being a relative term).  I do have a question - let's just say that the consensus of expert opinions favors the old over the new; what are consumers to do (assuming they want the car brand and model that has ""slipped"" during the transition from old to new)? If a 2009 BMW (or Mercedes, Porsche, etc) is superior to a 2015, many (perhaps most) consumers would still opt for the 2015 for reasons of reliability and durability (and factory warranty).  And, in the tests that I recall, the real performance differences between the old and the new are often only most noticeable above 8/10ths -- a place where few ever drive their daily drivers. So, even those who long for an E vs an F BMW or an Audi B7 vs a B8, etc, can't really go out and get a ""new"" E or B7; and, probably most of them want a 2015 not a 2008, 2009 or 2010.  I never had a V8 S4 -- and I'm told some were PO'd at Audi for changing to a super-charged V6. But I have nothing to compare my V6 T to in that regard, and hunting for a used S4 V8 is simply something I wouldn't even be interested in doing.  So the question is/stands: What can or will ""you"" (or the consumer) do? Seek out the ""better"" older version? Go to another brand? Take public transportation?  And, if newer models are actually better than the older versions and you just don't like the new ones, what will you do, boycott the company or fix and repair the old one until parts can no longer be found?

3362,"March  4, 2015 12:59AM",markcincinnati," I would assume you were not the target buyer of the car you bought/leased.  I know the Audi brand better so hopefully this is a reasonable parallel:  The new Audi A3 -- even the S3 -- is not at all attractive to me. The new Q3, likewise, doesn't do it for either my wife or me. I'd bet even the eventual RS Q3 will not be attractive to us. Maybe it is the size of the A3, maybe it is that it seems a class lower in terms of the materials used throughout the interior. I would, therefore, assume if I were to acquire an A3, even the Prestige quattro version with the most potent turbo-4, I would be working hard to figure out how to ditch it at the first opportunity.  Come to think of it, it probably isn't the size of the A3 or Q3, it is just that it seems too much like it is an Audi-light vehicle (and I'm not speaking of it's curb weight.) The CLA Mercedes and the BMW 1 series, likewise just don't do it for me. My wife was loaned a 1 series (and it had the turbo i-6) BMW -- I drove it, very powerful, but it seemed, somehow, ""cheaper"" in the materials it was made out of. The Q3, which we had for a day and a half earlier this year, didn't have the cheapness issue I noted in the A3, but it was way, way underpowered -- it felt like a Tiguan (doh! it is a fancy Tiguan, after all).  All of our Audis have felt at least adequately powered, so the current Q3 seems like it was pulled out of the oven before it was done. Maybe I'll change that opinion once the regular Audi 2.0T engine is in place.  The $50,000 S3 was twitchy, like a go cart is twitchy, it was noisy at speed on interstate 275, where I drive every day in my quiet S4. The vast expanse of black plastic on the dash looked like something out of the rental fleet at Budget, not something that the sales person has to say with a straight face: ""we can sell this one for $47,900!""  So, you leased a left over BMW that was probably meant for a younger, earlier in their earnings arc, customer. You paid too little, got too little and were underwhelmed.  On the other end of the scale, you may have been equally unhappy with an Audi A8 -- or BMW 7 series. These cars are developed with input from design, engineering, marketing, production/manufacturing and of course, finance. When deciding what to do, I would imagine those in charge decide ""there is a target market for an X5, an X3 and now an X1."" There's also a market, a narrow market I would imagine, for the X6.  Those $70,$80 and $90,000+ 4-door German coupes from Audi and Mercedes are not marketed, I would assume, to a 23-year old with a freshly minted MBA from Ohio State or a 25-year old who just completed his/her JD from the University of Cincinnati College of Law.  Is the wider net a good thing to do? I probably would have said no a couple or three years ago, but maybe now, the market is such that these premium makers want to get them (the customers) early (aka ""young"") and make certain there are upmarket models ""within the family"" to aspire to.  My sales rep at the Audi Connection told me his wife wanted a new Audi Q3 -- he had to carefully market and sell his wife first AGAINST the Q3 and then move her thinking to the Q5 or Q7, stopping along the way at the A4 based allroad. Why? Well, the Q3 was ""not enough car"" for her as a Fortune 500 executive with three children aged from 12 to 15, a big dog (her husband) and a border collie. The Q3 would have been a fine choice about 14 years ago.  And this guy sells cars for a living -- no longer are car sales people ""order takers"" (if they ever were).  Hopefully you get my drift -- your expectations and your ""situation"" were not a good match for the leftover BMW you leased -- and it was a disservice to you to not shepherd you through the buying process.

3364,"March  4, 2015  4:09AM",nyccarguy,"@markcincinnati‌  Sorry for the confusion in my post. I wanted to write a little more, but got called away from my desk while eating lunch (happens A LOT since my name's on the door). While the time I spent with the E90 328xi was brief, it was nothing short of amazing.  I had wanted a 3 series ever since I drove a friend's 1995 E36 328is 5MT through the streets of Buffalo late one night into early one morning. The car was just perfect. It fit me like a glove. At the time I didn't have too much stick shift seat time, but by the end of the night I was rotating the car car around corners.  I liked my Acura TSX that I inherited from my wife when we bought a Pilot to accommodate our upcoming 3rd child (she's 3 now), but didn't LOVE it. I saw an ad for leftover 2011 328xi BMWs, crunched some numbers, test drove the car, & fell in love. An inflated residual, $2000 in trunk money, 2 additional $500 payment credits, plus a $500 BMWCCA rebate gave me enough ammo to convince my wife that I want it & it makes sense (and cents).  My experience with the current crop of F30 3ers came when I brought my brilliantly balanced 328xi in for service. I drove a 328xi, a 320xi, & a 320xd. Nice cars. Very smooth riding. I'll even go as far as saying the 328 was MUCH faster than my inline 6's 230 horsepower. The chassis seemed to be stiffer. As an enthusiast, I just had little idea of what was going on. The car felt very disconnected.  Since BMW has moved into making their cars softer, they lost the edge they had over competitors like Lexus.  The scene at your BMW dealership on Saturday AMs is how things should be. Waxing poetically about their respective BMW.

3365,"March  4, 2015  4:10AM",roadburner," As to your first question, I will either seek out an older version or go to another brand; I like the M235i but I balk at paying around $3000 to get a true mechanical limited slip in a car that already costs north of $40,000- especially when such an ""exotic"" technology is either optional or standard on the GTI, Miata, not to mention every V8 ponycar. The vanilla F10 and F30 leave me cold, regardless of their horsepower, and my opinion is shared by much of the US enthusiast press(remember when Automobile and Car and Driver were constantly accused of being biased towards BMWs? When is the last time a non-M model won a comparison test?). Now you are absolutely right; the wearers don't care, and Munich apparently no longer does either. Fortunately BMW M is still cranking out decent cars. I think the new M3/4 is a return to form; I liked the E9x V8 but it drove like the true successor to my bitterly missed E24 M6- more a fast GT than a true sports car like the E46 M3. Ditto for the M5; the E60 V10 iteration was just a mess- the new car feels like it has a little E39 DNA spliced in. I have no problem maintaining my 2 older BMWs- one thing BMW still does right is provide for older models; thanks to BMW Classic I can get virtually any part I need for my 1975 and 1995 BMWs at my dealer's parts counter. If it isn't in stock I rarely have to wait more than 2-3 days.

The Acura has given me almost no trouble and it's a great car (and one of the good looking TLs rather than the later disasters), but it is still big and heavy and sloppy next to my A4.

3368,"March  4, 2015  6:25AM",flightnurse,"I'm gone for 2 days and this forum lights up...  First I laugh at people who criticize cars and brand after a short drive. Second, I pity the fool (in my best Mr. T voice) for criticizing cars without really driving longer then 1,2 or 8 days.  Lets look at the Geneses, Rick's Geneses has 65K miles on it, has only been in the shop for routine service. So basically flawless so far. So some of you say that people buy BMW's, MB's and Audi's because they want to prove something.. The Geneses is a very nice E class, for 2/3 the cost of a E class. I don't think anyone would say that the E class is a true sport sedan, and I wouldn't say the Geneses is one too, but after owning one for 3 yrs, I can say with fact that the Geneses is just as good as a MB E class or a BMW 528i (non line car.) Base price for those car's are 50K, a fully loaded Geneses can he had slight under 50K. The """"jittery"" suspension of the first Gen Geneses isn't a major issue, it's not a sport sedan and again it was never marketed as one. But if you were looking for a e class car, and price gave you a nose bleed, the Geneses was a great alternative.  Again on the comments about F3x, it's great people write reviews on these cars with limited real seat time, this doesn't make them ""experts."" Having 25K miles on mine, I have to say, this car has exceeded my expectation. This is why I'm looking at the F33 4 series Grand Coupe, I wish BMW would import the 435d, this would blend power and efficiency to a whole new level. But I'll take the 435i, however, when I'm ready to order my car it will be the 440i. Are the new F3x cars softer then the E series, yes, the ""true"" enthusiast can not keep BMW and Porsche in business so they had to do something to get a larger pool of people. I mean, for the people who buy the CPO cars, how does this keep the manufactures open? They don't, they keep the dealers open, it's the people who purchase new cars are the one who keep the manufactures open. I had always said, the E39 5 series was the perfect size car, and the F30 is slightly smaller then the E39. So BMW has been working on the EPS (elec power steering) to get the feel back, this would shut up some people. I just got back from a trip, slightly over 400 miles, I averaged 36 mpg, no one complained about cramp rear seats, and the ""numb"" steering wasn't an issue in which I couldn't control the car going up and down the mountain roads of southern AZ.  This is why Rick is getting a F34 328i GT, the car still has a very German ride to it, much more then his Geneses, the rear seats have more room then his Geneses and or a 5 series. Not everybody want a ride that is so stiff that there is a risk of losing their fillings.

The power was good, nothing to scare an S4. The brakes were very weak. The doors sounded tinny when closed. It was a beer to the Audi's champagne. Yet, much as most folks would never cross shop these two, it was Honda's bargain basement S4.  I have to assume the new TL is an improvement. Mine, a 2012, had way too much FWD feel (torque steer), something the S4 doesn't have.  I don't have the S's sport diff (torque vectoring rear diff), wish I did, but I would assume if I did, I'd love this thing even more.  This car and my wife's SQ5 have become our favorite Audis and our favorite cars -- and we've had dozens -- of all time. I want to say nothing even comes close -- but our BMW's have been close (and even a couple VW's were a blast to drive, but still none are the performers of these S's.) I used to think they (Audi S cars) were too expensive, but compared to 3-series, well it seems these Audis are ""within reach"" of most folks who shop and buy the cars discussed on this forum.  If you ""can't see"" or ""don't share"" our (my wife's and mine, i.e.) passion for the Audi S's, I would say the TL or TLX SH-AWD with anything that increases the performance/handling ticked off on the option list, is not a bad alternative (if you can get past the styling and the Honda content.) But, for the money, the Acura may be attractive to you because it will almost certainly stay south of $50K..  If you can't stomach the TLX's looks and the Audi leaves you wondering what I see in them, well, the C class Mercedes, too, looks like it is worth a second look -- and I've always had a soft spot for the Volvo S60 type R.  An observation: many who write here about their cars make remarks like ""my TL gave me 6 trouble free years.""

"" We test drive cars and seek out new restaurants as damn near professions as any hobbies could ever be -- so when it came time to drop the Acura and Infiniti, we seriously went into test driving as THE weekend event for a few months.  Here is what we noticed: Audi, BMW, Porsche and (to a lesser extent) Mercedes owners participate in ""clubs,"" attend driving schools, take road trips en masse, make trips to Germany to visit the Holy Land (the factories where their cars are made) and spend a fair amount of their disposable incomes on logo'd shirts, coats, key-fobs, ball caps, wrist watches, wine glasses, beer mugs and other branded memorabillia. Acura, Infiniti and Lexus owners? Not so much.  So, maybe my wife was onto something -- data points suggest the above mentioned Germans attract buyers and have owners who are passionate (they have soul perhaps?) about their favorite car brands. Other than some key fobs and a narrow selection of ball caps, only the local Infiniti dealer even had a Branded Boutique of items touting their owners love of their brand's cars.  The BMW store, in Cincinnati, offers free car washes -- so what you say? Well, arrive at the BMW store bright and early on a Saturday morning and you will see a line of BMW's, perhaps 20 cars deep, waiting to be hand washed -- sometimes the wait is hours. The customers park their cars, take a claim ticket from the attendant and gladly walk up to the service center's lounge where there is free Starbuck's coffee, all kinds of beverages and snacks and even portable DVD players and headphones with a choice of movies. Often the folks chat about their adventures in their X5's or the pleasure they had picking up their cars in Spartanburg and driving back to Cincinnait. Some folks regale others about their European delivery pick up in Munich and the fun they had driving on the autobahn.  Sitting in the Acura waiting area didn't even come close -- and there was no waiting room at the Infiniti dealer.  Somehow, the Germans seemed to have cracked the marketing code to imbue their cars, dealerships and, most importantly, their customers with passion -- soul -- for their fantastic creations.

The next day you can take the ski-lift up (and in July the view will be spectacular) where the 1936 winter Olympics were held. Then you can take another even more breathtaking cable car ride up the Zugspitze where you can have lunch and walk from Germany to Austria as the border cuts through the mountain. If you have time -- and I would urge you to make time -- you can drive your new BMW to Füssen and visit Neuschwanstein Castle.

Previously it wasn't very competitive at the entry level, but now I think it is. The most direct competitor is the 2015 Audi A3 1.8. Both are good cars, but here are few comparison points....  2016 ILX base $27,900 msrp 0-60: 6.2 (according to C & D) hp 201 trunk: 12.3 8 speed DSG 29 mpg comb  2015 Audi A3 1.8 $29,900 msrp 0-60: 6.5 (C & D) hp 170 trunk 10 6 speed DSG 27 mpg  Each one has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to standard equipment. The A3 has standard leather, standard XM in a better standard stereo, and split folding rear seats, none of which comes standard on the ILX.  But the ILX has standard the following things that I think are lacking on the base A3: moonroof, heated seats, LED headlights, rearview camera, smart entry/putshbutton start, USB port, 2 years longer power train warranty, Siri Eyes Free, etc.  Obviously somewhat difficult to compare, but I'd say that the ILX standard things are ""worth"" substantially more to me than the standards on the A3.  If you add a moonroof, pushbutton start, heated seats, back up camera, etc. to the A3 then the price seems to inflate to c. $36k or so. But the Acura model that would compete with that would be the ILX premium which is c. $30k msrp. That is a significant price difference.  The Audi has a lot more prestige than the Acura, but the ILX is likely to be more reliable and have a lower cost of ownership than the A3.  Yes, the ILX is based on the Civic, but then the A3 is based on the Golf, and so I don't see much of a difference there.

Also, I would think there won't be that much cross shopping of these two cars -- and I admit there is a good chance I am wrong.  There is something special about German cars -- eloquently described elsewhere by both the pro-writers and us amateurs -- that makes me think most ""Audi"" shoppers will first cross shop the other Germans, then perhaps another European brand, then, maybe, a Japanese brand.  I asked the Audi dealer who (the brand) they compete with. The answers depended on the car, of course, but the A3 and ILX were never mentioned in the same sentence. Now, granted, this is a data point; and this is perhaps indicative only of Cincinnati shopper's habits. The names (brands) brought up included BMW (doh!), Mercedes and Porsche -- the Macan vs the Q5/SQ5 for instance.  Acura's today inhabit that unenviable position where Audi used to live: Acuras are Hondas when spoken of; Audis used to be Volkswagens as recently as 20 years ago. It wasn't until Audi moved farther and farther away from being a VW that knows somebody, that they were able to break into the Premium class. Acuras, so I thought, had made some pretty good inroads into no longer being ""fancy"" Hondas -- remember the RLX from the not too distant past? Now, they've slipped -- and for all I know the slippage is deliberate -- and gotten closer to their Honda roots. Simultaneously, Honda has kept moving forward and upward at a pace that Acura has apparently not been willing or able to keep pace with.  Don't get me wrong, I can't pinpoint something with respect to my 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance that I can blast other than its ugly beak. Yet, just the reaction to the car itself was underwhelming. No one ever seemed to have any curiosity about my TL. The day I drove my new S4 into the office, however, folks were all over the thing, asking questions and showering it with praise.  The point is folks here in Cincinnati at least will fawn over a BMW, Mercedes, Porsche or Audi and will hardly give an Acura or Infiniti the time of day. The Lexus IS 350 F sport, however, will attract car buffs and elicit questions -- as will a Cadillac ATS.  Maybe it's just that Cincinnati is a German town -- sister city to Munich, after all -- but at this point in time, Acura's just can't get no respect.

Granted, BMW and Mercedes seem to do things differently than say Acura, or Infiniti (and certainly different than Cadillac). For example, try using the shifter in the BMW 5 Series or the column dhifter in most Mercedes. You kind of go....""who thoguht that was a good idea?"".  Audis better in that regard. But still, there seems to be a level of complexity in the German makers that isn't really necessary.

I am certain there are indeed car buyers who buy a brand for ""prestige."" There are perhaps business people who believe they must wear Armani suits, Prada shoes and sport Rolex watches on their wrists, and drive ""appropriate to their station"" autos for at least the reason that their clientele expect it of them. We may have become more shallow as a group of people overall (those of us in much of the world, not just the US); that is a debate for another place and time. The thing is, the folks [executives, C-level folks and VPs on up the chain] who hire corporate lawyers, CPAs, brokers, investment bankers, architects, interior designers, consultants and so forth would probably have different perceptions of the professional they were about to engage or the senior manager they were about to hire based on some of the candidates accoutrements.  Perception is reality so the saying goes.  You may be correct that a top o' the line KIA or Equus is virtually every bit as competent and luxurious as an S class, 7 series or A8L, but the market perception isn't there yet.  The point is not that someone may buy the car for the prestige -- although they may -- the point is that some force (""may the force be with you"") has imbued your Rolex watch with certain ""characteristics"" that set it apart from my beautiful, equally functional and competent-as-a-timepiece Tissot.  Given a choice, better yet, we've [all] learned that given a choice of being gifted with a new Impala LTZ or a somewhat like-sized BMW 5 series, we ""should"" pick the BMW. In the same vein, given a choice of an Acura RLX or a Mercedes E class, well, the Mercedes will be chosen over and over.  These assignments of prestige were earned somehow (weren't they?)-- is it possible it is because the E class or BMW or whatever has earned a reputation for inherent goodness and/or desirability and value that the RLX just can't compete with?  I don't know why an individual thinks they ""need or don't need"" prestige in their attire, car they drive, club they belong to or college they attend. I don't even care, really. What I am on about is how the thing -- that objet d'art -- perhaps got to be that way.  BMW's for example, may -- today -- no longer be the performance machines worshiped by some from an historical perspective. Perhaps BMW and the other [snooty?] Germans [and the people who buy them?] are simply resting on their laurels. Perhaps they are the naked emperors now. I wouldn't bet against them quite yet, however.  Perhaps Acura, Infiniti and Lexus (soon to be displaced by KIA, don't you know) will be dubbed the new Premium players by the cognoscenti of cars at Automobile, Car & Driver, Motor Trend, Road & Track and yes, even Consumer Reports. Look at the new CR magazine (best and worst car issue) and see where the Audi A6 comes in, just for the fun of it.  Most of us don't need our cars to be talked about. None of us wants our cars to be talked about as a negative reflection of us, however. But, we certainly don't mind if our cars (and the other stuff I mentioned above) paints us in a light that is positive. The real estate sales person who takes you around looking at houses in her new Q7 or Escalade may -- for good reason, who knows? -- make you feel like a winner compared to the sales person who drives you around in his obviously not new Chrysler 300. The lawyer who -- well you get the picture -- gives you confidence is probably the one who appears by some societal/cultural measure to be successful.  People need what they perceive they need -- and part of that perception of a given product comes from something the product has done to earn a certain reputation (prestige, some measure of prestige or lack of prestige altogether).  Cars are where they are due to many factors -- Acuras, not to pick on them, do not ""suggest"" the same thing as BMW's, for instance. You may or may not call that prestige, performance, price or even presence. Today, it is very, very likely that given a choice of a new Acura or BMW, ""most people"" will choose BMW.  The names Acura, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche, Cadillac, Lexus, Toyota, etc, etc, etc could have been used as substitutes in some of the preceding. It is not my intention to savage Acura or inordinately praise BMWs. Personally I am an Audi fan of the highest order. Between my wife and myself, we have owned American, German and Japanese cars since 1969 (mostly German, full disclosure).

It just seems that we have arrived at a point in time where the Germans -- for whatever reason -- rule.

3424,"February 24, 2015 10:56PM",markcincinnati,"A sub-vented lease can be a better deal than buying for many folks.  Years back, Jaguars leased for STUPID numbers (very very low per month) -- the cars were discounted, but not enough to justify NOT leasing. The odd thing is the leases were closed ended which meant there was no risk for the person who leased with respect to residual value.  Here's how they did it (or at least how it was done by some mfgrs):  The lease price of the car is the cost of the use of the car for X months (lets say 24 or 36). To determine the lease, the financial arm went ahead and jacked up the residual value of the car to something IMPOSSIBLE let's say 70% of MSRP. Then they took the 30% of MSRP and divided it by 36 or whatever to come up with a crazy, artificially low (sub-vented) lease price per month. In some cases what they did was purchase an insurance policy to guarantee the 70% or at least some part of the 70%. Then they made the lease have a get out early penalty that pretty much meant you had little choice but to keep the car the full 36 months or you would pay through the nose. In some cases you actually had to keep the car -- you could NOT simply make the remaining payments to get off the hook.  Yet, for those that wanted an $80,000 (pick a car) for $399 per month with no money down, there was simply no way a purchase made any sense.  Now, Infiniti certainly does sub-vent, but not crazy crazy like the above mostly true example. The payment for the use of the car is indeed artificially low, but remember you are paying for the sub-vented cost of use of the car (which is less than you would pay had you purchased the car up front).  Then at the conclusion of the lease there is MAYBE the possibility of getting the car for its real, honest, market value -- not the bloated, made up residual. If the car is good and you can get it at real true market value in month 25 or 37 or whatever, you actually did get a good deal since all you paid for was the rental amount for the past 24 months anyway and it was, er, ""rent controlled.""  Infiniti's can be a bargain when they are helped along via the finance arm via a sub-venting process. As far as Acura's are concerned, their financial arm hasn't always been a flexible in that regard -- but perhaps it is because they didn't need to with the MDX being the lion's share of their business.  It seems to me the TLX (and I come from a TL and actually liked it) was/is a missed opportunity to de-Honda-ize the brand. At this point, however nice they are, they are, underneath, Prime Hondas. That is not a bad thing, but the thing that I always thought about Infiniti was that they really did attempt to build a car that could rival a BMW. Acuras are still sold as FWD vehicles (a big mistake if you axe me), the Infiniti in question here is, actually, really and truly, a rear wheel drive vehicle that can be had with AWD (very BMW-ish, there).  Moreover, don't go thinking Lexi are much more of an engineering tour de force vis a vis Toyota as Acuras are compared to Hondas.  But, so it seems, the market has spoken and the Infiniti cars are not the leaders of the pack, more like the laggards of the pack -- hence super-sub-venting to the rescue which may move more of them off the lots until a new and improved version can be screwed together for your inspection.  We bought our first car last year a $65,000+ Audi SQ5 -- we put $22,000 down, have a 2.25% APR note on it and it is now showing at being worth about $48K. We still owe $33K on it. We've lost, in my estimation, $7K -- had the thing been offered with a sub-venting finance package on a lease, well, that would have been a no-brainer. We're hoping the plummeting cash value of the car will, in year two, hit the brakes and that maybe we'll have a point in time where the car ""feels"" like it was a better decision to buy than to lease.  We'll see how it goes.  Meantime who cares what the car's MSRP is? Not most Americans. They, er, WE, only really care about the monthly payment.  When a $50K+ car can be had for $399 per month for the life of its warranty and then simply dropped off with no muss, no fuss, well that hardly seems like a BAD thing.

That is, be a leader in engineering, performance, design, technology and value in the luxury vertical. RLX (and the RL before that) hasn't been relevant for over a decade. As good as the TL is/was, it was not the most handsome car on the road. The new one is better. Acura really didn't have an answer for the Integra's demise.

When the DSG oil gets too hot, I know the transmission will go into limp mode, that happened late in my A3's life after I had a bunch of mods on that one. Usually happened when you got near the last lap of a session, but it was annoying nonetheless. Given the R8 has switched and upgraded to a dual clutch DSG unit, I think they've resolved any issues with the DSG and power/torque. I'm not too worried about it. I think they know most RS7 buyers aren't planning to track it, so they made it a slushbox transmission."" I don't know -- and with all due respect, I don't know how you know -- about Audi deciding the RS7 customer would not track the car, hence they (Audi) decided not to use the transmission that they typically tout as the one they reserve for their high performance cars. It is as if their engine technology advanced more quickly than their transmission supplier could keep up with, so they used the 8-speed tip instead of waiting for the DSG to get strong enough to handle the power of the RS7 motor.  I have no problem at all with you upgrading your engine, knowing that the transmission will attempt to protect itself when it is pushed beyond its comfort zone. I don't have the money that it would take to self insure against the risk.  Frankly, I think it would be less costly to get a new ""S"" with the uprated engine -- when it comes out perhaps as a 2016 -- rather than push the DSG with the upgrade.  Of course, if you upgrade and nothing untoward goes down, well your risk will have been proven to be low.  My experience with ""chipping"" is perhaps why I am concerned -- I chipped my wife's TT and the power and acceleration were thrilling -- but the damn thing went from being reliable (and I assume durable) to needing constant visits to the dealer for things that seemed to have started coincidentally with the chip's installation.

3446,"February 16, 2015  4:47PM",andres3," I don't know -- and with all due respect, I don't know how you know -- about Audi deciding the RS7 customer would not track the car, hence they (Audi) decided not to use the transmission that they typically tout as the one they reserve for their high performance cars. It is as if their engine technology advanced more quickly than their transmission supplier could keep up with, so they used the 8-speed tip instead of waiting for the DSG to get strong enough to handle the power of the RS7 motor.  I have no problem at all with you upgrading your engine, knowing that the transmission will attempt to protect itself when it is pushed beyond its comfort zone. I don't have the money that it would take to self insure against the risk.  Frankly, I think it would be less costly to get a new ""S"" with the uprated engine -- when it comes out perhaps as a 2016 -- rather than push the DSG with the upgrade.  Of course, if you upgrade and nothing untoward goes down, well your risk will have been proven to be low.  My experience with ""chipping"" is perhaps why I am concerned -- I chipped my wife's TT and the power and acceleration were thrilling -- but the damn thing went from being reliable (and I assume durable) to needing constant visits to the dealer for things that seemed to have started coincidentally with the chip's installation.  My wife swore (and I couldn't counter her argument) that all the ills that beset her TT were chip related.  We traded the car in for a newer TT with the FACTORY upgrated engine -- the thing was bullet proof.  Summary: good luck and godspeed with your upgrade. I'll just wait for the factory to offer up an amped up S car without any post OEM help.   My A3 mods did the opposite of souring me on mods. If anything though, I felt they over advertised the power improvements , or at least overstated them, didn't pass the butt dyno.  I can understand being soured to tuning if you've had issues in the past. However, if the car was old, maybe it was just due to have those same failures anyway? Also, what kind of tune (company?) was it. I got Unitronics with the A3, and part of their sales spiel is that they tune it with OEM like reliability and durability in mind. Of course, my S4 tune will be Revo, so new territory.

3465,"February 11, 2015 12:41AM",benjaminh," As you say, I'm comparing the Audi A3 1.8 with the 2016 Acura TLX 2.4.  Car and Driver seems to put the A3 1.8 0-60 at 7.3, while the 2016 TLX C&D puts at 6.2. One second faster is a pretty significant difference.  When these two models are comparably equipped with leather, heated seats, backup camera, etc. I think the Audi goes for about $33k while the TLX goes for about 3k less. The Audi has more prestige and arguably nicer interior design, but the Acura is quite a bit faster and might even have better handling around corners. At least one test of the A3 1.8 that I saw complained about excessive roll and lean around corners. Plus, I think most would agree that for long term reliability an Acura beats an Audi.  Here's what Auto Week says at the end of it's review:  If you’re looking for an entry-level sports sedan, you’ll definitely want to consider the 2016 ILX now. The new drivetrain has done wonders for Acura’s gateway vehicle, giving it adequate muscle to make a stand against the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA. The engine is potent and is definitely a throwback to Honda/Acura 4-cylinders of old that once powered vehicles like the Acura Integra and Honda Prelude.  Handling will also remind you a little of the brand’s sportier performers from the past, which should be music to a Honda/Acura fan’s ears.  http://autoweek.com/article/car-reviews/2016-acura-ilx-drive-review",stand console plus litacurae think term im comfort week consider review looking difference heated comfort say auto long old roll brands equipped ’ secadillac acurax past potent fan 62 brand around 3k performers prestige performance backup nicer least sedan wonders 4performances becadillac audi test throwback arguably even performances 24 mercedes new heres hondaacura excessive 33k haudipautoweekcomarticlecarreviews2016acuraacuradrivereview done 060 entrylevel want might less two saw comparing lean significant make complained honda faster 73 prelude design console agree definitely second muscle vehicle preaudiy would performance seems end giving 2016 performanceier 18 mercedesmercedes etc puts bit goes remind acura quite put adequate performance beaudier says comparably ears one driver like also camera performanceed vehicles corners car performance gateway

I have dealt with both of them, but purchased every one of our Audis from one dealership -- now called The Audi Connection.  We have two BMW dealerships, too. Purchased three Bimmers from one of them -- The BMW Store -- over the years.  These two dealerships -- the ones that we have purchased from have been wonderful to deal with from a sales perspective AND a service perspective. Out of more than two dozen Audis we have had, we did have one that was problematic (actually the brakes were the issue). Audi of America sent their area representative to help out the situation. As usual, the dealer was helpful in making such a thing happen.  OK, I get it -- your mileage may differ. I agree with whoever said -- get rid of the bad ones (or words to that effect). No mfgr can tolerate even a very small number of crappy dealers. The Internet spreads the tales of woe like a Cancer. I know dealers are often local business people, not mega corporations -- although this is changing, in the era of the $1B dealership ""groups.""  The dealer can do harm, sometimes great harm to a brand -- and god knows Audi can't afford a sub-par dealer. No mfgr can.  If you need to buy or lease a new Audi and you are within 250 miles of Cincinnati, you can certainly buy one here -- but that probably does you little good with respect to service after the sale. You need a relationship with your dealer somewhat like your relationship with your ""barber"" (or hair dresser if you don't like the term barber). Of course, if you don't work at the relationship too, it won't pan out favorably, probably.  My Audi service mgr and I have been on a first name basis for perhaps 15 years -- our sales rep, in his mid-80's finally retired; he had been at the dealership since the discovery of dirt. Our new guy only has 12+ years with the dealer, he is so new he's still learning where the restroom is.  The time on the job of the various players at the dealership is a huge clue. If the lot tech guy and your sales rep have about the same tenure, you'd be better off finding out the tenure, overall, of the reps. Ditto the shop people, shop foreman, service manager and service writers. My service adviser has been at the dealership for at least a decade.

In some ways perhaps the Germans are ahead of the 2016 ILX. For instance, the A3 seems to have nicer interior design. And the BWM 320i, of course, is sure to have better handling.  But the Audi A3 under the skin has a lot in common with a $20k VW Golf. That doesn't seem different to me than an ILX having some common bones with a $20k Honda Civic. They take these bones, reinforce them, put new skins on them, put new engines in them, etc. Well, I'm not so sure about the engine for the A3, now that I think about it. Isn't that basically the new standard Golf 1.8 turbo engine? Not sure.  A turbo for the ILX might be nice, but I think the ILX 2.4 is already beating all of its competition with the base engines in terms of 0-60. And the competition isn't really weak, and so that seems plenty powerful enough for the likes of me.

3472,"February 11, 2015  3:31PM",graphicguy," Dealership is the front line of your ownership experience. As the old saying goes...""you only get one chance to make a good first impression"".  My wife is a lot more forgiving than I am when it comes to customer service. She's the one who is willing to give the benefit of the doubt. Me? I don't care if it's my real estate agent, my stock broker, my car sales person, or even my landscaper,  Car dealerships (and in turn, car manufacturers) expect me to live up to my commitment when buying a car to pull 10s of thousands of dollars out of my wallet for their product. I expect that they live up to their promise that the car will operate as they said it would. And, if it doesn't, I expect them to make it right without pushback. That last part is where Audi got in trouble.  The dealership Mark is referring to was actually at least moderately helpful, but still unwilling or unable (maybe both) to fix the car. Their Service Manager said the DSG trans and components of the Quattro system needed to be replaced. In a moment of unusual honesty, he said that Audi had a problem with some of the components for the drivetrain that were out of spec. He thought he'd get the green light to do the repair. That authorization never happened. The service manager said at one point that the Regional Audi Rep told him the car was too expensive to fix. Not that it couldn't be fixed, but that he thought it costs too much to fix it. Really? I mean REALLY? Guess what? It was 4X more expensive to buy back and label the car as a corporate buy back.  It wasn't just me with the issues. One of the trade rags I read after they bought mine back, mentioned the same issue. I looked for recalls. Never saw any.  The Audi Customer Service people suggested I take it to the other Audi dealer in town. I have no proof, but I think they looked at it, test drove it, called the Region, got stonwalled and essentially just changed the trans fluid. Clearly, that wasn't the problem as it still existed as I drove it away from their service bay. Took it back to them a 2nd time. Can't remember what they actually did, but it didn't fix the problem.  At that point, Audi had the car for a total of about 6+ weeks. They came back and said lemon law didn't apply because I had the car in for two separate issues. It was the same issue, that needed two fixes....Quattro and DSG. I don't know what they thought....perhaps I was just going to forget about it?  Icing on the cake....called Audi Customer Care (allegedly a Supervisor who had been assigned to my case), who proceeded to tell me the reason none of the local Audi dealerships would service my car, was because I didn't buy it from them. Uhhhhh.....izzatright? That's not what both of the Audi dealers told me. Game on. You're buying the car back, which they ended up doing.  I told Mark's dealer what I thought could have/should have happened. They should have either replaced the trans and Quattro components. Or, they should have just swapped the car for one that worked correctly. Neither was offered....and believe me, I did ask. They wanted me to take a about a $10K hit to swap out the car, though.

3484,"February 12, 2015  2:37PM",graphicguy," Sween....you and I agree (O.M.G..... . Wife being in an Accord, I'm beginning to see the Honda engineering in a lower priced car vs the Acura counterparts. I drove the TLX. Nice car. Not the same driving experience as the TL-S models or even the SH AWD TL that I had. Admittedly, I like the look of the new one better than the old one, but didn't have an issue with the ""beak"" look that others did.  Truth told, if Audi had just fixed my S4, I'd still be in the fold. Instead, they lost me. I have to believe I'm smack dab in the wheelhouse of their demographic, too.  Bang for the buck, an S4 is hard to beat.  But, as these things go, every body is stealing from everyone else. My CTS AWD has the trick torque vectoring rear that the Audi Quattro and Acura TL SH AWD have. My CTS has the twin scroll turbo that the BMW 4 cyl has (and more power to boot). Get the V-Sport (last year could be had for high $40s). and you get the 6 cyl with two turbos...wicked fast.  Took a couple of weeks, but once I got used to CUE, I ""get it"". And, I like it. My understanding is they went through a couple of interim updates to get it to this point, though.  ILX needs that turbo motor. Otherwise, stick with a Civic.  The Civic and Accord are great cars. Are their Acura counterparts worth $X,ooo more? It's not clear cut. So I guess that's pretty telling.  That said, I loved all the Acura I've had. Not sure they shouldn't just go ahead and just be an upscale SUV brand and be done with it. Maybe they're hoping the new NSX will breathe life into their car sales. The ILX and the TLX both need that turbo 4, though. The TLX, in particular, looks like a took a step back going from the sweet 3.7L in the previous gen SH AWD version to the 3.5L in the current car. Not sure what the thought process was there. In the tech dept, where they used to be at the forefront, they're now lagging behind, even with a totally new refresh.  BTW....here's my BMW dealer......http://www.sweeneybmw.com/index.htm   FN....if the prospect of getting $15K+ off a CTS wasn't out there, no way I would have entered the Cadillac showroom. My issues with Cadillac came before the GM ""purge"". I think the Cadillac dealers had to get into shape or the prospect of GM cutting them became quite real. That was very evident in my experiences with the same dealership 11 years ago, and the experience with them now. Truly, it was a night and day difference.  Drove the ATS. Thought it was a really fun car. A tad small for my tastes (reminded me of the A3, sidewise). Drove the CTS, and had as much fun, only with all the trappings of an E Class, A6, 5 Series......a better suspension than any of those, with better steering, braking, etc. A Cadillac....right? Who'd have thunk it.  Frankly, if I didn't get such a good deal on the CTS, I would have been targeting an IS350 F-Sport, probably this summer. That's a fun car, too.

Yet on the RS7 they use the 8-speed Tiptronic. The stated reason is that the currently available DSG can't take the forces generated by the RS7's engine. The article said the S6 was on the cusp of stressing the DSG -- and owners of an S6 were cautioned not to after-market upgrade the HP and torque (which is quite possible with the turbo S6 V8, e.g.).  Can the DSG in the S4 handle the upgrade you are contemplating and have a good long life? If not, what is the cost -- or risk in this upgrade?  My dealer says the S4 is going to have a horsepower and torque boost to keep it ahead of the standard V6T in the 2016 A6 line.

Or, the afore mentioned M235i or the ATS-V. Save a bit and get a GTI or R. Either would be more livable and you'd be able to stuff some green back into your pocket.  Ohio winters really aren't that bad, at least not compared to Boston, Chicago or New York. In the southern part of Ohio, we get a couple of dustings most winters. Every 3rd or 4th year, something more ""wintery"" happens, but I can live with that.  I have business colleagues who live in and around San Francisco. I tell them all the time, their winters can be difficult to drive in, too. They don't get any snow, but the Bay Area is wet and cold most of the winter. Not fun to drive in because their traffic is so much worse.  I like AWD installed in FWD platforms because it curbs some of the issues inherent in FWD cars. RWD doesn't have any of that.

3510,"February 10, 2015 12:50AM",markcincinnati,"The loaded S3 I test drove did indeed seem to just cross into the harsh ride category. The interior at freeway legal speeds seemed to show off its lack of sound deadening, too. A drive from Cincinnati to Cleveland would probably be wearying.  The performance was very impressive -- the thing was super willing to be at full cry seemingly in one second. The handling -- this one had the magnetic suspension option -- was confidence inspiring. The transmission was great -- better than any manual, BUT it was the 6-speed version. The 7-speed seems like it would be a better choice due to the addition of another overdriven gear.  The audio system was very good, not knock your socks off good, but premium ""enough."" That stupid pop up nav screen looks like one of those after market units (from Pioneer) from decades ago. Don't know why Audi chose to do that, when they had the built in look down to a science. But, that is personal preference.  For a change, Porsche now does the integration of the Nav.infotainment system better than Audi. What a world/  At a north of $50K price, the S4 (at least today's S4) seems like a bargain compared to the S3.. Of course a stripped S3 makes a strong performance argument, but, sadly, the premium-ness has been dialed way down. The interior is almost austere -- but perhaps minimalism is the look they were going for.  I would never get a black on black one -- the interior felt like a little teeny weenie cave -- a lighter color would have certainly upped the luxury/premium quotient.  Audi will sell as many of these as they can mint -- I would assume the market for the S3 would have to top out around mid-30;s (age wise). If you can afford an S3, you can afford an S4 and probably even a nicely equipped 3-series (without the i6 engine, however.) You can certainly afford a maxed out A4 SLine -- which wouldn't have the stump pulling torque, but it would have the 8 speed trans a less jittery sport suspension and actually FEEL like a premium car.

3512,"February 10, 2015  2:34AM",benjaminh,"Good reviews so far for the 2016 Acura ILX with the 2.4 DI engine (201 hp) and the 8 speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter. Starting msrp: $28k, undercutting the Audi A3 by $2k while getting to 60 more than a second faster....  From Motor Trend:  ""Acura lost the 2.0-liter engine and dropped in a 2.4-liter, direct injection, 16-valve four-cylinder engine that creates 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. It also introduces the first dual-clutch eight-speed automatic transmission with a torque converter and paddle shifters that seem to always know the right gear at the right time. It launches with aggressive power, and once first gear winds out, it quickly shifts and maintains that torque until you let off the gas. There's a touch of torque steer to pull you to the right under heavy acceleration off the line, but that quickly disappears and leaves you with a compact rocket on the road.  The electric power steering is taut and very linear, snapping back to center with ease. Driving around Napa, California's, winding mountain roads, the ILX kept its line through every corner and never let up. It's smooth but feels quick and allowed me a chance to make my driving partner just a little bit carsick after a few twisty corners. Acura also improved the car's braking, allowing it to remain smooth and quick. For those who want the car to do the driving for you, the ILX offers adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. I'm not particularly fond of the lane-keep assist system, because it seems to work even when I didn't want it to, pulling me back to the center of the lane during faster driving, but I should have merely turned it off then. On the highway, it does a nice job of smoothly adjusting the car back to the middle of the lane.  Acura added a number of quieting technologies in the car, including active noise cancelation and additional deadening materials. This was quite noticeable. The car is remarkably quiet, especially considering it's built on the Civic platform, which is not the quietest compact around. A quiet ride remains one of the hallmarks of luxury, and the ILX allows for easy conversations at any speed. The interior improvements are just as noticeable as the exterior ones. There are steps up in the quality of materials, the soft dash, and nicely done stitching throughout the cabin. (The A-Spec model includes aluminum floor pedals and special seat inserts.) There are all of the regular luxury items, such as a moonroof, a clean instrument cluster, and comfortable heated seats. When you sit down in this car, you notice that it's nicely done.""",deadening aggressive driving never feels improved litacurae performance comfort adjusting horseperformance shifters smooth paddle notice im 2k corner pulling 24liter shifts added heated chance adaptive system easy comfort leaves carsick road work trend secadillac let platform every twisty motor moonroof direct quieting inserts lbft brand reviews around creates 60 seem gear includes touch msrp back 8 geaudiing injection roads noticeable considering know performance kept linear fourperformance exterior winding technologies fond pedals special didnt partner clutch line highway snapping efficiency quietest introduces 28k 16valve audi rocket dropped remarkably braking especially ease nice performance performance aluminum offers even 24 disappears items regular good center right winds done napa want remains far taut heavy pull make allows comfortable mountain quality honda faster theres nicely job starting performance always smoothly including ride control first converter quiet steer lane clean dual remain cruise second electric 180 allowing ones time steering californias active built merely seems maintains soft 2016 instrument turned compact performance di console aspec materials cars 201 comfort assist performance undercuaudiing numercedeser additional particularly bit quick cancelation dualclutch hallmarks steps acura quite cluster eightperformance allowed one sit improvements also launches cabin corners performance throughout car stitching middle quickly floor lost 20liter lanekeep connissantions noise
3513,"February 10, 2015  2:35AM",benjaminh,"Another review of the 2016 ILX by Left Lane News:  ""Cruising along the Silverado trail in Napa, California, gave us a quick taste of the ILX's improvements. From the moment we pushed the red starter button, we could see that Acura had corrected many of the motivational issues that plagued the last car. And to their credit, Acura executives acknowledged as much, when during the presentation about the vehicle's new features, they stated that they had taken many an expert's comments to heart.  In addition to the lack of power, one of the bigger complaints of the previous version was the excessive road noise that made its way into the cabin. The NVH guys got it right this time, utilizing tricks and techniques that made a huge difference that was quantifiable in back-to-back tests.  For 2016, buyers will get a taste of just what 51 extra horsepower and an additional 40 lb-ft of torque are capable of, especially in a car that weighs only 3,100 pounds. We found a compact four-door sedan that offered up just the right amount of torque steer when we launched from a standing start. They didn't post exact times but Acura officials state the ILX gets to 60 mph 2.5-seconds faster than the model it replaces. And that was in the normal drive mode. Switching over to sport mode allowed us to put the paddle shift levers to good use as we blipped our way up through the eight-speed gearbox. Offering a different feel then that found in the normal drive mode, it allowed us to hold our gears as long as we wanted while negotiating the twisties in Northern California's wine country.""",along performance horseperformance paddle post issues standing review complaints amount previous difference utilizing feel long could road comments guys extra huge times taste weighs plagued capable credit twisties lbft brand acuras 40 addition buconsolen fourdoor 60 see maintenances news gears many much performance 3100 normal another california sedan blipped features silverado gave didnt motivational made acknowledged especially performance cruising start levers switching drive officials pounds country nvh good last new right excessive hold exact offering quantifiable stated napa gearbox gets trail moment experts backtoback faster left wanted us taken steer lane 25seconds version pushed negotiating time launched californias different get buyers bigger 2016 51 compact way presentation state performance got additional found offered quick use shift starter lack acura red tricks put eightperformance allowed northern one corrected improvements cabin tests vehicles techniques car executives wine mode heart noise

3517,"February 10, 2015  2:03PM",graphicguy,"Read a blurb yesterday stating that Acura is getting ready to bring back turbo 4 cyl motors (which seems to be the price to play in the premium segment). and it's speculated that one will land in the ILX. Wife tried one before settling on the Accord. Tough sell. Small, underpowered, and more expensive than her loaded Accord. Hard to make that fly.  I did like the TLX. But, I didn't like it as well as the TL. So, no go there, too. RLX? Should have saved development money and killed it off. It's barely selling as well as the previous dismal RL. My hope is that there's something Acura is planning (maybe the turbo 4 in the TLX) like a TLX-S because as it stands right now, they're an SUV brand, who happens to throw a few cars in the showroom just in case you need one of those, too.  No secret that Audi just seems to confound their customers...whether it's ""Sween's"" $300 oil change, or them playing ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" about the problems my S4 had. Troubling enough it was on the dealer level. Worse, the Audi factory team weren't any better. That attitude eventually catches up to you. You'd think their customer service would be a lot better given how they were almost wiped out of existence in the '80s with the hatchet job they got with unintended acceleration.  S3 will sell. Not sure the age group. It gives a lot of performance. But, those it's targeting are raising families. Is it big enough? For $50K is it really nice enough?? Interior was underwhelming, as Mark pointed out. The materials were not what I'd consider worthy of a $35K car, let alone a $50K car. And, it seems to be a German thing, but who was it that decided a stuck on LCD screen sticking up in the middle of the dash was a ""new trend""? Somebody in their design dept needs a serious remedial course in aesthetics.  Even if a childless couple ends up liking the S3, not sure it's demeanor will appeal given some alternatives who have sharp handling, and a more sophisticated ride. My money? Stuck in an Audi showroom with no other competitor to be found within 1,000 miles? I'd write the check for the S4 for about the same money. Better car, better interior, better suspension, better transmission, better engine....better all the way around.  BMW? Cadillac? VW? Any of those dealers close? I'd be sticking my checkbook back in my pocket and looking at those over the Audi.  Even Mercedes, which has given up its chase to be a sharp performer, puts out a decent product in the $50K range...C Class. Aside from the silly stick up screen (again), it has a nice interior and makes no apologies that it rides nice, while maybe not offering the last 10th in handling or performance.  Buy, the CLA's suspension is every bit as ragged as the Audi's. Interior is....ummm....interesting. Not nearly as nice as the ATS nor an uber conservative 2 or 3 Series. But, it has a star on the front. So, for many, that's all that's needed.  I liked my Audi...when I drove it off the showroom floor. It became troublesome almost immediately. When the dealer stone walls you (and I'm not the only person who's had that happen in these parts), it makes a frustrating situation unbearable. So long Audi.  Had sterling customer service from BMW, and again with my CTS. Need an oil change? New wipers? Got a little parking lot ding? No problem. Leave it with the dealership, who gladly gives you a loaner to use, only to get your car back later all clean and shiny with everything taken care of.....NO CHARGE!  Geez.....that got long winded.

The problem was weight, high speeds from all that power, and OEM brake pads. I went through 7 or 8 mm of front OEM pad in one weekend, and ruined my front rotors in the process (and blew a rubber gasket on the caliper too). I drove the snot out of the car, and it was fun, but I was left wanting more braking power. Went with the Hawk blue box HPS pads, as I'm told the OEM S4 pads are designed for A4's and their typical drivers, in frozen weather for the NE USA. Not for warm Southern CA tracks. Shame on me for assuming S4's had better brake pads than A4's.  So my brake pads killed my rotors at 15K miles. Lesson learned.

Oh, I need to correct that: the Audi Connect feature (free for 6 months) was great (when it worked) when I was ""in signal."" The thing is, someone at Audi of America made a deal with ""the fastest"" 3G provider (at the time) T-Mobile. However, at least in SW Ohio the coverage, at best, is poor-to-fair, and overall is 2G to poor. The screen indicator registers 2G about 1/3rd of the time (which renders the feature useless). Now, it is true that when T-Mobile is able to pump out true 3G it can be as good as what sometimes passes for 4G from some carriers.  I had enjoyed using this feature with the voice command to verbally invoke ""Internet Destination, Morton's of Chicago"" or other destinations that would have normally had to have been found via calling 411, getting the number, calling the ""destination"" asking for the address and THEN entering it into the sat nav.  The thing is, the price for this service is $30/month -- which is galling since the TV commercials claim (for SW Ohio) 4, 4G LTE lines (family promo) for $100/mo.  Of course, were I to buy a new A3, Audi Connect no longer uses T-Mobile.  I'd pay $10/month for this crappy (T-Mobile) service -- but $30 for 2G? No way.  The concept and the technology (in the car) make a lot of sense and when things work as expected (even in 3G) the execution is great (within a two block radius of a certain signal location). Swapping out the radio or ""unlocking"" the radio via software or some other method (the sim card?) would make my experience with this vehicle ""the best ever.""  For those folks who want driving performance, I can assure you the S4 (with the 7-speed DSG) is, let me see, effortless to drive, meaning that there is nothing (within reason) the car won't do without breaking a sweat. Another descriptive term: ""carve"" -- driving the car is as effortless as cutting warm butter with a hot knife.  Obviously, I am off-put by one little piece of tech that some folks who live in a strong T-Mobile reception areas probably can't relate to.

3572,"January 16, 2015 10:24PM",markcincinnati,"Reliable and Durable:  I am not a good ambassador of/for the durability of [Audi's in particular] German cars -- since the highest mileage I've ever put on one was just south of 67,000 miles (a 2005 Audi A6 3.2). However, my Audis (and we've had dozens of them) have always been very reliable (excluding our 1978 Audi 5000 which did die young, or at least the battery died young). We never had what I would call a catastrophic failure of the drive train in any of them, period.  Moreover, I suspect our 2011 Infiniti FX35 would have ""run perfectly"" until the wheels turned square and the pistons fell apart -- but we only kept it until it had some 55,000 miles on the OD, so again, who knows -- it, like our Audis was totally reliable. And then:Our 2012 Acura SH-AWD seemed like a budget Audi S4 (a good thing), but it certainly felt both flimsy and tinny (even the doors closed with wimpy thud). And the brakes had about one good stop in them from speed before they faded; and, the rotors almost always felt warped -- even though much of that turned out to be three bent wheels (that Acura paid 50% of the cost of replacement). Three bent wheels? Even if I was abusive while driving, I still find it hard to believe there were 3 bent wheels -- and that the original dealer never thought to road-force balance the wheels to see if THAT was the reason the brakes always appeared to chatter and rumble so.  I have to assume the new ATS and CTS (I did drive the latter) are very fine cars -- my in-laws were Cadillac people, but their experiences were with much older models (pre-2007) and during those [dark] years, their Cadillacs could hardly drive past the dealership without needing to go in to remedy some malady or another.  Cars of all ilks, today, I must assume are very reliable and probably durable, too. I am thinking that based on the way my wife puts miles on her SQ5, we may want to trade it in after about 36-42 months due to the ""depreciation"" hit that happens at about 100,000 miles, not due to any serious ""durability"" or reliability issues.  I can't remember where I read (or heard, perhaps) that virtually all ""modern"" cars will be essentially trouble free (not necessarily low maintenance, though) for a minimum of 150,000 miles. One of the folks I work with has a Bimmer (530) with over 170,000 miles on it and has never had any major repairs, only the maintenance required by the book. He's had dents and dings aplenty (and had them all fixed), but nothing major, ever.  My friend says he puts about $500 in the car two or three times per year -- and everything works pretty much the same as it did when he bought the thing new in 2004.  I'm a fan of the ""factory"" sponsored extended mntce and warranty programs -- and in my case, since my car is leased, I can have the car CPO'd to 100,000 miles for about $1,500 as long as I do so under 50,000 miles and have proof I've maintained the scheduled mntce requirements.  I keep thinking this S4 is so good it will be a keeper -- at least so long as at least one of our cars has the latest and greatest technology. That's the drawback -- as each new gen of these cars comes out they add or update some ""gotta have"" feature or tech (yeah, ""gotta have"" for me, that is). My friend who is part owner of an airplane says he just keeps upgrading his decades old plane with the newest and greatest tech and rebuilds the engine so that despite its age, his plane is actually kept completely up to date. Makes me wish at least some of that approach would trickle down to automobiles.  First thing I'd do is swap out that T-Mobile Internet connection module/radio. Why can't there just be a jack that allows the car to ""sniff"" the Internet from my iPhone. I know, follow the money.  In conclusion, congratulations and kudos to those of you getting new Cadillacs and frankly just about anything new that might qualify today as an ELLPS or LPS car. I wonder, too, at the price point, if the new Genesis is yet a candidate for either ""class"" [of car] -- I've looked at them and they are seriously -- almost Audi A6 -- nice.

I think all manufacturers, but particularly the American marques, have made such great strides in build, reliability, and longevity that is unparrallelled in any time in the industy's history.  It used to be Honda or Toyota were the brands you bought for reliability. Not so sure you can make a significant case for that any more. Aside from Land Rover and Smart, who iare notoriously troublesome, one should expect a long, durable life from all of today's cars.  Technology in cars is moving at break neck speed. You mentioned having your car become a wifi hot spot. Who would have thought of that even 5 short years ago?  In these classes of cars, in addition to great motors and transmissions, suspensions become much more sophosticated. I know in the CTS, I'm amazed at how smooth the suspension is on the interstate, and at the same time can carve up some backroads with equal sophistication.  With the torque vectoring you find in your S4, and what I had in my TL SH AWD, Cadillac has their own version of it, allowing rotation and curve hugging that borders on the unbelievable.  Even the materials in cars of this class are first rate. While both my Audi and TL had pleasant materials, Cadillac is using real wood, real aluminum, real chrome, real suede, controls work like they are bathed in butter or have a tactile feel that really begins to define what the marketers are striving for.....a high end, high quality look ad feel.

3583,"December 27, 2014  8:55PM",markcincinnati," Wow! That's variety. My question is this: would there be a market for 107 variants of the 3-series in the US? And, that question assumes the cost of marketing to ""the market"" would have to include certification for the US. My assumption is that the market for 107 variants of the 3-series just isn't there, for if it were, it would seem to make sense that BMW (of America) would go ahead and import (and bear the cost of certification) the ""in demand"" portion of the range up to 107 variants. Someone, in charge, must have the data to support not doing this -- and by data I mean sales data or market research in support of increased choice.  Of course I said my assumption -- is there any reason to think there IS a [profitable] market for that kind of variety?  While I am at asking [hypothetical] questions, I am wondering why I've never seen an Audi or BMW (or any other brand, perhaps excluding Porsche) with a red leather interior ""in inventory""? -- yet it seems that ""everyone"" says they love red leather interiors. Both my wife and I had to order red leather in our 2014 Audi S cars -- despite the dealer telling us that if they do a dealer trade and end up with a car with red leather that such an outfitted car typically sells more quickly than one with, say, black or gray or brown leather.  I assume the dealer rep was probably patronizing us [regarding red leather] (at least a little bit) but the claim is that white is the single most popular car color and dealer inventories (of Audis and BMWs) do seem to support that notion.  One more question: what does it mean to say something to the effect that such and such a brand of car is ""worn"" (as opposed to driven, I assume)? I read the comment that new BMWs appeal to customers who want to wear their cars -- suggesting to me that the characterization ""worn"" was pejorative (at least as far as the author was concerned).",never ive litacurae market think inventories sells wife comfort telling gray include sense worn research variants typically comfort say patronizing hypothetical ahead variety portion 107 america author dealer styling regarding effect brand driven sales trade seem bear reason nissanions outfiaudied least characterization 3series black marketing range increased cost appeal assume concerned support data audi must single someone bmw white new love demand comment brown customers assumption order want yet kind far make mean inventory wear said popular us wow notion read would perhaps seems end isnt pejorative comforts seen course certification everyone probably import cars nissanion rep 2014 mercedesim asking porsche bit assumes go something opposed red choice profitable says one wondering despite excluding car charge thcadillac suggesting quickly

3587,"December 30, 2014  4:29PM",graphicguy,"Sorry FN....just saw your question. Spent last week visiting wife's brother in San Francisco.  I got the CTS AWD Performance version. The Magnetic Ride suspension is the real deal. Allegedly, the MRC is capable of infinitely changing the shock settings something like a 1,000 times a second, depending on road conditions. It has its own version of torque vectoring. These ""trick"" torque vectoring schemes really do improve the handling of these cars (as with the Audi S and TL SH AWD).  It smooths out the roughest roads, yet stays sharp when cornering and rotating. Like most cars in this class, the adjustable suspension is available. I keep it in ""Sport"", which firms the steering response (best version of electronic steering I've used) and changes shift patterns. Feels much like a RWD based Audi Quattro or TL SH AWD.  Put it in ""touring"" mode, and it feels much like a 4matic E class or an A6 Quattro.  Sport mode, while ""firm"" really doesn't describe the ride accurately,  Great seats, while not the sport seats in the TL SH AWD (which I loved), but certainly more ""sporty"" and comfortable than the hard, flat Mercedes seats. and not nearly as ""hard"" as the S4's.  Not as speedy as an Audi S4, but quite torquey. Probably 0-60 in the 5 1/2 to 6 second range.....works for me. Probably more torque in the lower rev ranges than the TL....especially around town. It gets up and scoots to extra legal speeds in short order on the highway.  All the gee gaws. It took a few days to get used to CUE. But, now that I am, all the controls for it fall immediately to had once the proximity sensor senses your hand near the screen. Touch controls work. Instead of sliding the ""metal bars"", you realize those bars are only there to guide your fingers. You slide just above the metal bars.  All the chrome, wood, aluminum, suede, leather, etc is all real. Build and materials are all exemplary and as good, or better than anything in the class.  For reasons that befuddle me (and probably Cadillac, considering the accolades the car has received), the discounts were substantial on the CTS.

My dealer says he sells every $85K Escalade he can get his hands on....at MSRP plus. Cadillac split their lux sport sedan series in two. What used to be the CTS doing battle against the 3 and 5 series, the C and E class, the Audi A4 and A6, is now the duty of the ATS against the 3, C and A4, with the CTS doing battle against the 5, E, and A6.  CTS moved up the ladder, with the ATS going against the cars we talk about in here.  Their President even admitted this isn't going to happen over night, but will probably take a couple of years.  Cadillac is in a unique situation where they don't seem to care about their ""traditional"" customer. I don't know if they ever would have snagged me unless the CTS were such a very good car to begin with.  You'll have the customer who bought a previous gen of the CTS and walk into the showroom thinking ""no way I'll spend $7K more for the new one over the old one."" Cadillac points them in the direction of the ATS and says....here's a better car than your previous CTS and it costs less. Some will get that. Some won't.  However, if you want an even better car than the ATS, here's the CTS.  Again, it will take some time. And, some won't even like the way the new ATS or CTS drive, given they are more on the sports end of the luxury sports sedan/coupe market.  But, once they take hold, I think they have a very good foundation to build on to compete, and excel in both spaces.  They seem determined to do what it takes to get there. Good cars.

3636,"December 27, 2014  6:07AM",markcincinnati," ~ BMW has not done much, if anything, because it ""needs"" to make money. It is a for profit company it does everything it does because it must make money -- fine point between needs and must, I know, but I think it is a given that all of these automobile companies are for profit. They were when they made the versions of cars that ""used to be"" so much better -- if they actually were better then than they are now.  The perspective that I hold currently is that BMW is actually making cars they have evidence their customers want. They have ""proof"" that their new cars are an improvement over their previous models and their customers affirm that proof. If the customers don't affirm, they make changes to the cars until the cars ""succeed.""  A key reason for the almost total abandonment of the manual transmission, for example, (by BMW, to name just one) is the customers (BMW is seeking) perceive them to be less desirable than the automatic shifting transmissions available.  Said another way, automatic transmissions are superior to manual transmissions -- according to the market BMW caters to and wants (and needs and must) to sell to. That is an empirical fact -- it is not an opinion (based on the results that can be measured). If you -- the rhetorical you -- believe a manual transmission is superior, that is your opinion. The facts do not support the opinion, or if so, only slightly. Now one may prefer a manual transmission (again this is but one example) over a manual transmission, but that -- from the perspective that BMW values -- is an outlier, an anomaly, virtually irrelevant.  I believe I have suggested previously, that ""we"" killed manual transmissions -- we killed them by not buying them, not because they weren't or aren't offered; they're not offered because we didn't buy them.  Likewise, 4 and 6 cylinder engines (as another example) replaced 8 cylinder engines because ""we"" deemed them superior -- and proved thus by buying cars with 6's and 4's. The market proved that there really was a substitute for displacement -- and that was volume-metric efficiency.  I do not believe that ALL new BMW's or Mercedes or Audis or whatever brand you favor are superior to their ""ancestors"", but the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of them are.  I applaud anyone's affection for nostalgia -- I am often sentimental; the older I get the more I represent that remark, in fact. But nostalgia often -- some would say always -- represents a filtered view of the past. BMW (et al) would almost certainly fail if it attempted to build its new cars to emulate its previous generations, no matter how highly acclaimed or ""remembered"" they may be.  Auto transmissions, forced induction smaller displacement engines, softer riding suspensions and more and more reliance upon ""technology"" are good things, superior things, actual improvements over previous generation's offerings and capabilities.  You may not, for whatever reason, agree -- but the market, fundamentally, says you're wrong.  Now, being somewhat (sometimes) of a fellow Luddite, I did (and sometimes still do) mourn the virtual and soon to be total death of the manual transmission. However, now that I have 20,000 miles worth of experience with an Audi 7-speed DSG connected to a super-charged 6, I must finally admit Eli Whitney had a pretty good idea after all.

3638,"December 27, 2014  4:04PM",cdnpinhead,"The emphasis on electronic gadgetry and increasingly complex solutions to fairly simple problems (8-speed automatic transmission, anyone) is what leads so many people to dread running these ""new and improved"" cars bare (past their warranties).  I fail to see why EPA/CARB-driven cars are superior to the incredible variety of vehicles that are available in Europe and elsewhere in the world. Certifying a drive train is so bloody expensive in the U.S. that any given manufacturer limits what's sold here to a bare minimum. If BMW sold any of the small diesel wagons (with a manual) that have been available for decades elsewhere here in the U.S. I'd already be driving one.  Oh, and if anyone thinks run-flat tires, another solution looking for a problem, make any sense out here in the West, I'd be interested in their reasoning. Driving hundreds of miles with only rudimentary services available, particularly on the weekends and/or at night, without a spare tire of any kind, is asking for a three-day delay while the necessary $300 tire is shipped to within 50 miles of where you had a simple flat tire. Then there's the question of whether the tire machine at Ed's Gas, Bait and Whorehouse in Austin, NV, will be able to get it installed without totally wrecking the new tire, the wheel, or both.

The governmental rules and regulations do not single out BMW or Cadillac or Fiat. The playing field, so to speak, is level. How a company responds to these regulations is what differentiates it.  Overwhelmingly, the reason the cars from BMW are they way they are is because these cars sell -- if manual transmission diesel Bimmers, etc, were selling, they'd be brought into the US (assuming they are actually manufactured).  In the universe that I am familiar with, I know that Audi of America responded to a LOUD, but very very tiny campaign (that I participated in) to reintroduce the manual transmission to the A6. Audi went ahead and made the A6 manual trans version available to US customers. The cars sat on the lots of understandably pissed dealers who bought the cars for inventory only to have them sit and sit and sit for months and months.  I did go ahead and order the ""last"" manual transmission (think of the song the ""Last DJ"") Audi of size in 2003. It was an allroad and I had to special order it because the dealership general manager told me he had been burned by millions tied up in floorplanning manual trans A6's to an unmoved and ""I'll take my business elsewhere"" market.  The last BMW I drove was a 2014 5 series with a bunch of options including X-drive and all of the stuff BMW deems fit to call ""sport"" or at least sport-like. The car was quick, fast, quiet, comfortable and for its size cornered like a snake in a rat hole (credit my wife for the phrase).  One of the folks I work with has a 2005 BMW 5 series -- there is no comparison, the 2014 is the more desirable car.  The car is what it is due to the votes cast by the market. We may, or some of us may, deride the newer cars as mere shadows of their ancestors, posers even; but, again, from the perspective of the engineers, marketers, sales people, etc associated with BMW, the new cars are improvements, advancements of the ""breed"" (or brand, at least).

3651,"December 19, 2014  9:10PM",markcincinnati," Well, here are some thoughts on Infiniti -- from a former owner of an Infiniti product and also, at the same time, an Acura product.  The auto manufacturers in the past decades have wanted to ""rationalize"" their product names. They have wanted to do so for essentially a singular purpose: marketing (leading to increased market share, mind share, sales, etc.)  Infiniti decided that Q was the answer as a prefix and that the following numbers/letter combination would signify the size or perhaps even class of the vehicle. I would assume if money were no object they would have liked to have rolled out a completely new -- across the board -- product family. They had to settle for one new car, the Q50. The M37 became the Q70 as you identified.  It is true that most of us here on Edmunds know the Q70 is the former M37. I would posit that most people, however, won't have a clue that the Q70 is a renamed product.  The M37 and the Q70 are still very competent LPS offerings, even though the Q70 does need to be updated, refreshed or replaced with a newer version. To me, Infinitis have often been [note the tense] the most German-like of the Japanese (and Korean) offerings. The recent ""transfer"" of their President, Johan De Nysschen, (then late of Audi) to go to Cadillac probably is a negative for Infiniti -- but, well, there you have it -- since I would have assumed Johan would have made good use of his 19-year Audi stint to imbue Infiniti with even more German-ness.  Right now, it seems to me that Infiniti and Acura, both, appear to be somewhat rudderless if their recent products are any indication of what is going on ""at the top."" The TLX could've have been the vehicle for Acura to announce ""we're not Honda anymore,"" but I think they missed the target completely if you axed me.  Meantime, Lexus has inched its way even further from Toyota and the Koreans are the ones the Germans are probably seeing in their rear-view mirrors more so than anything out of Japan (with the possible exception of the IS350F-sport).  Again, if you axed me, the saving grace for the Germans is the brand name ""KIA"" -- at least if you live here in River City where removing all the KIA badges seems the norm. If KIA somehow figures out a new name (think GoldStar becoming LG) for their brand, I would think the Germans might have more to worry about.  Today, the Germans seem to be the aspirational cars -- but, as the poet Frost once said, ""nothing gold can stay."" I did enjoy my time with my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, but -- money not a factor -- my 2014 S4 is an entirely different experience (despite my belief that the TL was about as close to an S4 as one could get for about $47K.)

That makes the 2015 Genesis V-8 a midpack performer, depending on what you think its competitors are.

She kept her 39 month lease vehicle 35 months and I kept my 36 month lease TL SH- AWD Advance 25 months.  These cars, hers an FX and mine a TL were stickered at a combined $97K. The leases had to have been subvented by the mfgrs and the cars were reliable (and I assume durable) and well made with several obvious (and successful) attempts to move them upscale from their Nissan and Honda lineage. Perhaps for the right money -- and it would have to be seriously inexpensive -- a new TL, Q or IS (I actually ordered the Lexus IS-350AWD F-Sport) might have made it into our garage.  Since we test drive cars almost as a hobby, we were really -- this time -- able to see how far the Germans had come since our last German cars, hers a 2008 BMW, mine a 2009 Audi.

The hell of it is, her description is perfect -- in tone, tenor and accuracy. The Germans, today at least, have indeed again found that certain something that can best be described as soul. And, the money (when leased) is no longer an excuse to 'settle' for the more or less soul-less vehicles currently marketed by the big-3 Japanese ELLPS and LPS providers.

The IS 350 F-Sport version has some positives going for it.  Power train - the 3.5L V6 has remained essentially unchanged since 2006 as has the 6-Speed Automatic still found in the AWD version.

Two of my friends (one is an aunt) acquired new ELLPS (1 Lexus and 1 Infiniti) cars. One of these folks (who will remain otherwise unidentified) was going from one city to another about 30 miles apart. The call to me proclaimed ""the GPS lady gives incorrect instructions"" -- and my friend ended up in a city some 60 miles in the wrong direction.  Now, I have had numerous GPS systems, my first in 2001. I have had the experience where the GPS lady did indeed provide incorrect directions (but I still arrived at my destination, just with a long detour). The last time I had a car provide wrong directions was in 2004.  The ""science"" of GPS technology and the map makers themselves have improved greatly is the point. Or perhaps the point is the GPS lady was not wrong -- and if you would have followed her directions you would not be 60 miles out of the way.  I said nothing to my friend.  I am thinking I will suggest a return visit to the dealership for a ""training class"" on the marvelous tech these Japanese cars afford. Of course, my other friend was unaware of the car's sat radio tuner and when I turned the radio to the sat band and found Classic Vinyl, my friend was amazed -- no commercials and tons of music.  Analogy: Maybe we've reached the point where CD's and iPods or iPhones (for music) are good enough and DVD-Audio despite its amazing quality, is just not worth it to most folks.  I remember, too, Sprint spent a ton of money on the sound quality of their network only to find people would rather have fewer dropouts than hi-fi sound from their cell phone network.  These cars have lots of tech, to be sure -- but other than the folks reading and writing here on Edmunds, I wonder who is actually using automatic cruise control, lane keeping, in-car Internet and even google earth (which is, at least, pretty cool to play with even if it is not really all that practical).  Have we reached some kind of saturation?

Cadillac is really stepping it up. CTS has turned into something I never would have expected. They're shooting at E class, 5 Series, and A6, and bulls eyeing the targets, in some ways, exceeding what the others are doing.  Test drove the ATS a couple of times. That car's a blast, too. You'd like it.  Leather....I've heard the argument that Mercedes ""pleather"" is better than leather. That mostly came from their dealers. However their fake stuff may or may not wear well, I'm sure it's cheaper for them than putting leather in their cars.  Even old leather looks great. Not sure that old vinyl will look all that good down the road. I know old vinyl never smells good. To me, it's a cost cutting move by Mercedes. I can't imagine paying $50K? $60K? Maybe more, and not getting leather as part of the package.  If I were going to see any potential problem with the new TLX, it would have been with their transmissions. Acura/Honda has had a bit of a history with dicey transmissions. I really like the TLX. I hope they get that shift button thing sorted out in short fashion, and it will only take once. They are kind of on a sales roll with their vehicles right now. It would be a shame that this would bring them to a halt. If they've stopped selling the TLX, it looks like that's exactly what happened, though.

A ""nicely equipped,"" but hardly Porsche equipped pretty much to the max will be close to $10K more. My Audi dealer says the Porsche will be almost $15K more ""similarly"" loaded.  I don;t know how accurate that latter claim is, but the Macan S can easily go well into the $70's and the Macan Turbo can pass $100K -- but it will be about a half second quicker than the S and the SQ5.  The US SQ5 is also sold only with a set ground clearance, and the Macan is both lower and can be had with an adjustable suspension.  Those who want more headroom, too, will consider the SQ5 since its proportions are more generous for rear seat passengers and their stuff. I thought the two cars were redundant, and I can still convince myself of that, but I can also see the Macan appealing to a different audience, but then, at the price, the Macan is now able to actually be more expensive than a Cayenne.  I'd test them both unless you have a specific purpose that only one or the other fulfills.  The SQ5 does have more HP and torque, and an 8 speed non-dsg transmission -- to the Macan's 7-spd PDK.  Both are very fine examples of excess -- in a CUV suit. We have 25,000 miles on our SQ5 -- and would get another in a heartbeat and we have driven both cars; we like the higher ground clearance of the Audi and the nearly $10,000 lower price is a plus too.  The S6, at its price, doesn't seem to have an analog from the other Germans. The BMW 535 doesn't even come close and the 550 isn't as sticky as the S6 (thanks to quattro).  I can't really call the S6 a bargain, but it does offer the buyer more content for the MSRP than the BMW. I'd avoid the 20"" wheels, but that is a personal choice.  I floored the S6 and counted to 3 -- when I looked down I had gone beyond 100MPH from about 60. Nothing I've driven (other than a Corvette) even comes a little bit close.  The S6, to me, seems just a bit too big, just like my S4 seems a bit too small -- so I look forward to a larger S4, although the S6 is my ""lust for"" car.  The least talked about ""car"" if you axe me, is the SQ5 -- it is a vehicle that deserves a bit more exposure.

The following list of – hopefully descriptive – terms, apply to the latter activity, or better said apply as descriptive terms of the test-driven car, this past Friday (the day after the food coma).  Clarification of the terms, that is how they may be applied, is noted (in parentheses):  -Aroused (you don’t start this car, you press the button on the console and it is “aroused”)  -Audacious  -Bland-looking (dashboard)  -Brutish  -Close (front seat)  -Cramped (back seat)  -Crude-ish  -Dart-y  -Expensive (unfortunately, equipped as it apparently needs to be equipped, it is easily 10-15% too much money for a car that has luxury intentions but doesn’t deliver much luxury despite its long list of features)  -Fast (as in, “How fast would you like to go sir, I can manage 150 if that would be sufficient.”)  -Firm (harsh-es kinder gentler side; this car is capable of firm only on the smoothest of road surfaces and/or above 85MPH)  -Fun (to drive for relatively short distances)  -Harsh (on secondary roads you are punished over every patched pot-hole you drive over, pounded by every expansion joint you meet and slammed when you drive over the various undulations presented by our aging highway infrastructure)  -Jittery (think hum while strumming your lips)  -Loud (road noise, wind noise is minimal)  -Minimalist (the large expanse of black plastic on the section of the dash in front of the passenger isn’t exactly cheap looking, no, it’s not that, it just looks boring, unimaginative, perhaps like there is some carbon fiber or brushed aluminum trim piece that was accidentally omitted)  -Nervous (the car, not me)  -Nimble (turns like a go-kart)  -Noisy (not much isolation from the engine or the road – makes conversation at speed require LOUD TONES even for the two front-seat passengers; I could imagine it would require yelling for back-seat passengers to hear or to be heard)  -Powerful (not quite OMG, but very much like a two-year old V8 Mustang, in fine tune)  -Precise (I imagine it feels like a Swiss watch, if you could actually drive one, that is)  -Punishing (see harsh above, but add to it a couple of kidney punches thrown in just so you don’t get the impression this car could be, in any way, considered supple)  -Quality (the feel of the switchgear is like a German chef’s knife in your hand – makes other knives (and other cars) feel just a tad bit of a lesser tool)  -Quick (dart-y could have sufficed, and “quick” is not the same as “fast” – this car is seriously quick at 0-62 in 4.7 seconds)  -Raucous (the road and tire noise would argue against a cross-country trip in this car)  -Raw (I guess I need to point out that it is also – in some ways – refined (see below), at least in terms of the power-train)  -Refined (the fit and finish are great, the doors close with nary even a hint of a tinny sound, everything is solid)  -Responsive  -Rough (you probably could have deduced this by now, but I need you to know that this only applies to the ride – the engine is like buttah)  -Sensitive (have you ever seen an old movie about a safe-cracker; you know the guy who sandpapers his fingertips before he begins turning the dial – his fingertips are sooo sensitive he can “feel” the tumblers falling into place; well, this car is sanded fingertips sensitive)  -Slick (the transmission, although “only” a six-speed, this transmission mates nicely with the smooth, powerful engine)  -Smooth (the engine)  -Solid (like a brick, you know what)  -Sonorous (the engine – ok, here’s a preliminary reveal – you would not be blamed if you thought this engine was a 6 or 8 cylinder with an old-fashioned air-sucking, honking wildly, air-intake; but you’d be wrong, this engine is the devil’s own 4-banger, avert your eyes, carry garlic cloves and cover yourself with wolfs bane just in case)  -Stiff (harsh-es kinder, gentler, cousin)  -Sublime (the seats are so good in this car they could almost make you forget its boy-racer characteristics)  -Tense (this thing is really on-edge once it is put in gear)  -Tight (jam up and jelly tight – I never knew what that meant in the song, but it seems to fit here) [I've been told Jam up and Jelly tight is a sexual reference, so I'll let it stand]  -Tiring (again, lovely car to drive about 20 miles, maybe even 25 miles; just not the kind of thing you’d want to take long trip – even of a 100 miles – in repeatedly. . . you’d just be worn out from the, er, Sturm und Drang  -Twitchy  -Urgent  -Unyielding  -Violent  -Visceral  -Wearying (see tiring – in short this is a $50,000 go-kart; and, there is nothing wrong with that, but I think, given the car’s lack of Premium-ness, I’d go for the Subie WRX and pocket the difference).  Much to like, a bit less not to like, but overall “at these prices” you do have the choice of giving yourself kidney punches and endure about the same cacophony (maybe less, even) in the Subaru WRX.  The car in question?  A 2015 Audi S3 with the Prestige and Sport packages, plus the upgraded seats, trim and premium paint.  I so wanted to love this car – and I must compliment Audi on figuring out how to make a 4 cylinder growl and snarl -- and yes I know it is partially the work of the audio system, but who cares? (all the while being as smooth as silk) like a Mustang V8 (circa 2012) – but the thing, as fun as it is to drive for a relatively short distance, just doesn’t feel like it is a Premium Class car (beyond the interlocking 4 rings on the front and rear) – it feels like what I imagine Subaru is shooting for and largely doing (but for a lot less money) with their current WRX's.  The Audi’s 19” wheels and tires may well be the culprit, but the almost total lack of sound deadening (well, OK, not really) just doesn’t do it for me (especially when the thing is north of $50K). Getting out of an S3 and then driving off in an S4 is like night and day. The S4 may be more isolated, better at mastering road imperfections and designed to press your kidneys rather than punch them, and that’s what makes even the “old” tech 2015 S4 still a bunch more car for just a little more money and the S4 actually feels and looks like the 4-rings suggest it ought to feel and look like.  Oh, BTW, the S3 has fantastic LED headlights – and the thing is a looker. But $50,000+? Nah.   Keep on driving it like YOU live.

3767,"November 10, 2014  9:20PM",markcincinnati," ===== Here goes: =====  I'll stick with the A3 & A4 to introduce a new forum class for ""LPS"" [suffix'd] cars.  For the moment, let's say the ELLPS class is solidly where the new A3 belongs, To me, that seems to suggest the A4 (and the 2016 A4 leaps to mind) is no longer an ELLPS, nor is it an LPS, since the A6 is the representative of the LPS entry from Audi.  Well, two LPS classes used to be sufficient -- but over the past few years car companies have scrambled to ""find a hole"" in the market and create a new car model to plug it. And, no hole seems either too big or too little -- model proliferation is the norm these days.  Audi and BMW (and Mercedes too) have become the masters of model proliferation, it seems.  And, just about ""everybody"" demonstrates ""wheelbase"" [or overall length] and girth growth every time they birth the new generation of a model. The BMW 3, for instance, has grown so much so that it is, in many ways, larger than a not-that-old 5 series. The current A4 used to be the size of the new A3 -- and when the current A4 was introduced in the US as a 2009 model it's wheelbase was within a fraction of an inch of the size of the then current A6. I know, I had a 2005 A6 that I kept for 6 months after the lease ended so that I could move to the new A4 and not have any period of time where I was not in an Audi. When the 2009 A4 came in to the dealer, I pulled my A6 up beside it -- and it was virtually impossible to tell the difference between the two with respect to wheelbase.  The A4 got big! Then, when the new gen A6 came out, it, of course, grew in size -- the A3 was in the pipeline (not the 2009 A3, which was essentially a VW) and what we have in the brand new A3 is a car that plugs the hole left by the move up of the A4 into what used to be the size class of the A6, Numerous examples of this phenomenon can be cited for the cars that come from BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac and Lexus.  We now have -- at least -- 3 size (and price) categories for cars to fit into and still be, in some fashion (class) LPS cars. ELLPS, ILLPS & LPS is my proposal.  ILLPS means Intermediate Level LPS also known as a member of the phylum: Luxoperforiososedantis.  So, assuming we all accept the notion that three LPS classes are now appropriate, we move the current (and certainly 2016's upcoming) A4, 3 series and C class (while were sticking with the Germans) to the ILLPS forum and open up the new, 'blank slate', ELLPS board (forum) for cars like the new Audi A3, BMW 2 series (which may be problematic since it doesn't have 4-doors as far as I know) and the Mercedes CLA (which is a 4-door coupe, according to MB). We move the CTS firmly to the LPS forum and put the ATS in with the ILPS cars if its wheelbase (among other things) doesn't force it into the ELLPS class.  I would think wheelbase would be one criteria, total length and width of the car two additional criteria, base price and 90% maximum price yet an additional criteria, and so forth.  Which brings me to perception.  I cannot -- YET -- place the Hyundai Genesis (for example) in the mix of LPS anything; however, there is a strong resemblance to some of the phylum's class members at least insofar as luxury content is concerned. I would assume the Genesis will be an LPS member someday.  Perhaps time in the market is a criteria -- no one wants a poser -- and it takes time to earn your place in phylum Luxoperforiososedantis.  In any case, the time has come for the current ELLPS suspects to move to the ILLPS forum.

The RDX is certainly nice looking and is, as noted, high content for the money.  It is, however, an appliance, a very good appliance but rather unremarkable if you are looking for anything beyond modest (and I think that is generous) performance.  The RDX, like all Acura's is probably one of the most reliable and I would, therefore, assume durable vehicles in the small to mid size CUV universe.  Life, as I now know, being north of 60, is too short for boring cars.  My vote would be for the X3 of the choices suggested -- but I did much appreciate the XC60 T6 when I floored the accelerator -- the thing has some serious torque, the X3 (at the price point) couldn't even come close.  The X3 however felt like it was on rails.  Here is the test I use -- I find a curve on a secondary road -- a very lightly traveled secondary road. I look for a curve marked 15mph or 20mph (at most). Then I approach the curve at more than double the posted speed; next I brake hard for a moment to reduce speed to double the posted speed and to force a weight transfer to the front wheel. As I enter the curve at 30mph, I accelerate hard as soon as the front wheels have passed the mid point of the curve.  If the car easily remains in its lane, I repeat the process at triple the posted speed.  The X3 easily handles this ""experiment"" and the feeling is that it could go at the corner at more than 3x the posted ""suggested"" speed. The RDX (old version with the turbo 4 and SH-AWD could do this all day.) The new one plows and crosses the center line. The XC60 was a T6 Type R and it felt in good control of its understeering urges too. But the Volvo was much closer to its limit since it didn't shift enough power aft since there technically was no actual loss of traction.

To get the same or similar content, the BMW was even more expensive; and I think she felt the SQ5's interior, sport seats in particular plus the B&O sound system cinched it -- almost. Panther Black Pearl paint sealed the deal. That plus a 6% discount on NOT your garden variety Q5 or X3 -- Audi iimbues its ""S"" cars with ""that certain something"" -- undoubtedly sealed the deal.  Having matching interiors was probably a minor influencer, too.  She has had 2 X3's since 2005 -- very fond of them. But, if you've never driven an SQ5 at full cry, you may not quite understand the almost immediate reaction: An ""addiction"" to the sound and the fury, wrapped up in what seems to be a premium CAR -- the BMW for all of its inherent goodness just doesn't seem as nice of a place to spend hours in. Then, of course, there is that oh-so-cute flat bottomed sport steering wheel on the SQ, too.  If you can take an SQ5 out for a test drive.  On the other hand . . .  The BMW is better balanced -- but the SQ passes the triple speed around the curve test with ease and poise. As a practical matter, that attribute felt pretty much like a draw, despite the BMW's less heavy nose. The Audi engineers did a very nice job taming the potetial understeer of the SQ's fatter front-end.

3805,"November  2, 2014  7:54PM",markcincinnati,"And the punchline is: ""He Only Took Tips!""  A tip for those who are either owners of or contemplating one of these ELLPS or ELLPSUV/CUV's -- assuming the vehicle in question is not a BMW.  Here goes: many, probably most of these cars tend toward -- or outright already have -- some degree of nose heaviness. Audi is certainly not known for ""50 - 50"" weight balance, for instance. Acura, Volvo and most certainly others (again not BMW) are absolutely nose heavy when configured as 2WD vehicles (since they mostly are FWD when ordered thusly). More and more of these ELLP vehicles are ordered every year with 4-driven wheels (the up take here in SW Ohio is now for ""mostly"" AWD versions -- even most BMW's and Mercedes are acquired with AWD so say the dealers). Alas, even the AWD versions are nose-heavy.  The thing that I've learned that is a quick, easy and virtually free way to improve upon some of the effects of being a bit porky on the front is to inflate the front tires +2 pounds more than the rear tires; and, typically to inflate the fronts to one or two pounds MORE than the factory sticker suggests.  My S4 says to inflate the tires at max to 42 pounds. I inflate front to 43 and rear to 41 (using the free nitrogen ""air"" Costco offers its members).  We had a cold snap here in River City yesterday -- of course the air pressure in all four tires dropped dramatically -- we went from 70+ degrees to overnight temps in the upper teens with a daytime high an optimistic 41.  Since I was at Costco getting my fill up of their Top-Tier premium, I also went for the free air fill-up. Based on the length of time before the ""ding"" indicating 43 pounds, the pressure had to have been over 5 or 6 pounds below that.  To ensure the tires were cold, I drove to Costco, parked and went shopping in the store for a while, then went to the tire dept for my fill-up.  I kid you not -- and I've known this for years, yet I was as pleasantly surprised as could be -- the turn-in was IMMEDIATELY sharper, like the car had been placed on a set of shiny new rails.  OK, that is the ""free"" (as in almost zero cost) tip.  Here's one, that when coupled with the above free tip, will further dramatically improve your heavy nosed (and this one works on any car) ELLP vehicle's steering dynamics: switching out of the factory tires (unless certain tires are already on your ELLP car) into the top of the line performance tires in the class (of tire) that you would normally drive.  For example -- here in SW Ohio -- no one (well, virtually no one) uses ""summer"" and ""winter"" tires -- they use either ""summer"" tires year round or (more likely) all-season tires, year round.  The Germans have even gone so far as to specify as no cost options, typically, the ability to order your car with summer only or all season rubber. Dealers typically order their for-stock vehicles with all-season rubber to keep their customers from complaining about the super fast tire wear and the almost unusable traction summer tires offer to those of us who do have temps that go below 40 - 45 degrees from time to time (our typical winters are usually above freezing, but usually below 45 which is the kryptonite temp for summer only tires).  The thing is, a lot of the ""all-season"" tires are either Grand Touring tires or are simply H rated all-seasons (generally from a well-known brand and generally with a fairly long tread-life expectation).  My S4 came with H rated Grand Touring tires. What were they thinking? Offered up to order is an S4 with either summer or all-season tires. I checked the all-season box since, well, you know, I live in Cincinnati and we really (usually) have very mild winters in terms of both temp and snowfall. Why do I need dedicated winter tires in my climate, so to speak?  I don't.  Grand Touring tires are fine -- but, if you ax' me they have no business on an Audi S car of any stripe.  What is better -- much much better? Easy-peasy: an Ultra-High Performance All-Season tire from one of the name brands all of the German's buy from. We ended up with Continental ExtremeContact DWS Ultra High Performance All-Seasons from Tire Rack -- shipped to the dealer, installed and road-force balanced. These tires should have their picture placed beside the word ""sticky"" in your Merriam-Webster.  They have super-stiff (compared to the rather comfy-biased Grand Touring H rated rubber that the S4 came with) sidewalls and they are Y speed-rated. Of course, since I ordered my car with the all-season tire option, Audi saw fit to engage a max-speed limiter that tops out at 130 (easily switched off, if you really think you're going to need to exceed 130MPH).  So, you can, for relatively little money (close to zero) noticeably improve your ELLP's turn-in, gas mileage and overall handling by simply cranking up the fronts to +2 pounds over the rears and by cranking up the front 1 or 2 pounds over the door jam's ""suggestion.""  Then for what will probably amount to $700 to $1,000 all-in (but for some of these cars that you can order 20"" wheels, the $ amount will be higher), you can take the next big step and get rid of the almost certainly ""wimpy"" tires the manufacturers seem to put on these cars when the ""no summer only"" tire option is checked.  Virtually all of these ELLPS, ELLPSUV/CUV vehicles are nose heavy -- which manifests itself as under-steer. It is unlikely you can, as the saying goes, put lipstick on a pig and turn it into a Porsche in the handling department -- but, with my hand raised on high, I can attest that by doing both of the suggested tips above, I even transformed my TL Advance from somewhat of a farm-implement (i.e., it could tend to ""plow"" a little bit even with SH-AWD) due to its less than ideal 60-40 (or something like that) F/R weight distribution) into a confidence inspiring and -- with a consideration for its price -- ""S4-light"" ELLPS.  Of course, in the case of the Acura TL Advance w/SH-AWD the 19"" H rated tires that it came with couldn't have sucked anymore even if their name was Hoover (I crack myself up).  So, my friends and fellow posters, if you're laying out something north of $45,000, you can for no to relatively low money transform your baby from ""nice"" to a vehicle that, quoting my wife, ""goes like a snake in a rat hole.""  If you play your cards right, you can make the UHP all-seasons (or whatever you and your ""climate"" could call optimum) part of the purchase/lease deal when you order the car or before you sign on the dotted line to buy/lease one off the lot.  Hopefully the above will have some merit and even more $ value and most of all ""fun to drive"" value for at least one forum participant.

3811,"November  3, 2014  7:54PM",markcincinnati,"Continental ExtremeContact DWS Ultra High Performance All-Seasons have, as some here have alluded to, been somewhat dethroned in the most recent Tire Rack test:  ""Michelin has reset the performance standard for an all-season tire with their Pilot Sport A/S 3, which delivers impressive handling in both dry and wet conditions. And while not apparent during our short road evaluation, when running laps on our test track at the limit this tire showed a little more tread wear than the others tires. But this focus on ultimate performance during the summer months compromises its wintertime capabilities somewhat. The Bridgestone Potenza RE970AS Pole Position is a pleasure to drive, with a satisfying feel in the steering wheel and good handling in dry and wet conditions. However, it falls way short of what most drivers would consider adequate in winter conditions. The Continental ExtremeContact DWS doesn't quite have the nimble feel of the others, but offers good ride quality and reasonable handling along with good overall traction regardless of the weather - dry, wet or winter.""

If I lived perhaps 100 miles or so due south of Cincinnati, the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3's would certainly vie for my dollars.  The further north I might live, however, the Conti DWS UHP's would still be the ones to beat based on the Tire Rack review. The review does tend to make me think the DWS's are much more of a compromise than anything else, but they are much stiffer than the standard GT Contis that came with my S4, very quiet and they do improve the handling of the car as noted in my post regarding air pressure and tires.

I assume I am in the majority who just aren't willing or perhaps even mentally willing to spend on two sets of tires. I admit the solution you two have chosen is superior.  My original point was to suggest tips that would improve your (our) lot in life -- if we live in a place that has moderate winters or in a city that mitigates the impact of snow with super human snow removal and lots of road chemicals.  Were I a resident of, say, Minnesota or North Dakota or perhaps even Michigan, I may feel the need for four dedicated winter shoes.  Were I the type to really push my car (S or no) to more than 85%, perhaps that too would argue in favor of summer MAX Performance tires (my 2009 A4 did come with MAX performance 35 series 19"" x 255's -- they lasted 11,000 miles).  I like to drive somewhat at a higher level than, I assume, most US drivers. I have a car that allows me to be a better driver than I probably am (in real life); I have been to 4 Audi driving schools in Austria, one Porsche school in little ol' Dayton, Ohio and a BMW X-drive school in South (and North) Carolina.  I have the schoolin' and the car to get 'er done -- therefore, I find my skills and my car to be under-tired with the mostly crappy all-seasons manufacturers foist upon Americans who (mostly like me) don't do what you two do.  I am lobbying the manufacturers (Audi in my case) to consider stepping up to UHP A/S's rather than the much lower ""performance"" rubber most manufacturers shod their cars with when the customer orders ""non-Summer"" tires.  I take my hat off to your two who are willing and able to not go for the optimum, rather electing to go for the maximum you can get, even if it means changing your wheels and tires out twice per year.  For those who aren't willing to walk the walk (that would be me) of the twice yearly ritual, all I am hoping to convey is that there is a much much better performing car waiting to be let loose if you will at least upgrade to UHP A/S;s rather than not even know what you're missing.  You two, indeed, drive it like you live. I applaud your behavior but I'm still OK with mine.  You might say, and I do, that good is the enemy of great.

3842,"October 26, 2014  6:44PM",markcincinnati,"S4 M3  Much as I love my S4, the M3 and S4 aren't in the same class -- Audi's S4 is the competitor to the BMW 335 (and to be fully comparative, the BMW would have to be an X-drive version.)  There is no RS4 (US) available which would be the M3's competitor.  I believe the S4 used to be the M3 rival, but once ""RS's"" were introduced the ""S"" moved a step down the performance ladder.  The net of this is to clarify that the S4 is still in the ELLPS category, no matter how much it can be optioned to (well over $60K in a New York second).  For the record, I wouldn't kick a 335 out of bed for eating crackers -- hell, I'd even bring the crackers.  Perhaps I lucked out with my S4 -- based on the way I equipped it; it seems the ""distance"" between an all singing, all dancing, S-Line A4 and an S4 is remarkably short. If you're looking at an A4 with a bunch of options, the S4 with not so many options, is just a smidge more (on a lease) than the ""lesser"" 4.  My wife's SQ5, Prestige, too, was ""within reach"" of a Q5 3.0T -- and, like the A4 S4 comparison, the ""S"" cars are remarkable, almost thrilling, performers.  The top of the line versions of most of the ELLPS cars are -- almost universally -- great performers available for something far less than a King's ransom. And, what you end up with is very close to the driving fun of a true sports sedan.  Of course, the ""bottom of the line"" of the ELLPS cars is/are still firmly planted as a card carrying member of the ELLPS family. Yet, for folks who frequent these formums and the brand specific sites, my assumption is that very few of us look to the ELLPS brand of our dreams and think, ""I'm gettin' me a strippie . . . ."" My conclusion is that the mavens who are participating here are more likely than not to equip their cars with a lot of performance and tech options -- and probably a fair amount of ""L""uxury features too.  The ELLPS class here on Edmunds, IMHO, has to be one of the most active boards and enjoys the participation of mostly very passionate (and opinionated) car lovers.  Much as I love cars like the S6 (if there are many ""like"" the S6), I think the S4 ""class"" (ELLPS) is really where the action and drama lie.

Just as this video shows, the S60 just walks away from the TLX, as did the XC60 very impressed with the amount power it makes. So for 50K you get a fully loaded top of the line Volvo XC60 that can run with the other guys. I noticed that invoice for this SUV is 48K and people having been paying under invoice for it, also if you do the Euro Delivery you save 5% of the purchase price, PLUS 2 round trip tickets to Sweden, hotel stay (one night) and 15 days of insurance.

3850,"October 31, 2014  7:16PM",markcincinnati,"I would agree with the 2002 observation -- and even agree perhaps for a number of years after 2002; but we're just about at the end of 2014. My point? Things have changed in 12 years.  The 335, the S4 and some incarnation of the Mercedes C class are ELLPS cars based on the places we could logically and appropriately place them.  And, while I am certain you could find ELLPS cars all day long with ""about"" a $40K price tag, it does seem -- now -- that because there is both a stronger ""P"" and ""L""component in the acronym (than 10-12 years ago), that the price of entry has probably crept up to a more realistic level of $45K or more.  As I mentioned, I believe that because folks here on Edmunds are er, more passionate, about cars and they really do want both the P and the L, ""strippies"" of some of the ELLPS cars are probably not what we're opining about here.  Now, along comes the new ELLPS class, perhaps?  What [or, perhaps, WHERE does it belong?] is an A3 or more pointedly an S3? It/they, today, could possibly be argued as deserving a footnote or honorary inclusion into the ELLPS class. But perhaps with the 2016 current ELLPS models looming ""larger"" (perhaps somewhat literally) than today's and certainly larger (for the most part) than the A3 (with its shorter wheelbase and girth), perhaps the entire current membership of the ELLPS family needs to be moved to a newly named forum vacating the ELLPS space thus allowing the A3, S3 and the soon to follow cars from Asia, Europe and the US, to fill in as the NEW NORMAL ELLPS cars.  Of course, if that happens, where does a BMW 3 or Audi A4 or Volvo S60 or TLX, Q50 or, or, or, end up? A 3 series will not be welcome in the LPS forum discussions -- will it? A 3 series is not a 5 series an A4 is not an A6, and so forth.  The lines blur, they come into focus, they blur again; the cars get bigger (almost univerally) every time a new generation is released. A 2014 3 series seems bigger, to me, than a 2003 5 series -- etc etc. So what was true in 2002 just doesn't carry on (my wayward son.)  What's between an ELLPS and an LPS anyway? PPPLPS - Popularly Priced Premium Luxury Performance Sedan (or would that be the step below ELLPS?) Or perhaps UMLPS - Updwardly Mobile Luxury Performance Sedan? Maybe NQQFBLPS - Not Quite Qualified to be a Full Blown Luxury Performance Sedan. No no, how 'bout ILLPS in keeping with the ""E"" for Entry -- we bump it up to: Intermediate Level Luxury Performance Sedan, and we move the current ELLPS players into the ILLPS class and move the up and coming ""Jr ELLPS's"" of today into the void left by moving the current folks from ELLPS to ILLPS and so on . . .

3860,"October 11, 2014 10:34AM",brian125,"How about the Tesla Model X SUV. Is 70k worth a 95 mile range?   Base price: Currently unknown, but expected to be around $70,000.  Fuel economy: Unknown, but based on the Model S specs, expect a figure around 95 mpge from the 60kWh battery option.  Pros and cons: The Tesla Model X, expected out this fall, is the crossover to wait for if you want something truly different. In true Tesla style, it’s completely electric; it features falcon-wing doors that lift up and an all-wheel drive option that will make it the first production electric car to run on all fours; and it also has Tesla’s trademark 17-inch touchscreen center console. It has the usual EV drawbacks, though: limited range coupled with potentially long recharging times.  Options worth splurging on: It might come to the detriment of range, but the all-wheel drive model might be too good to pass up.  These vehicles are in the baby phases. Give this industry another 5 to 10 years with more research and cost cutting ways where most buyers can afford similar models like mentioned.   Tesla moved an estimated 4,600 Model S vehicles in the U.S. in the first three months of 2014 -- 1,600 in March and 3,100 in January/February. 11,000 vehicles have been sold to date this year.

We were able to take one for a test drive. we drove a Model S 85, it wasn't fully loaded and MSRP was cough $98K , walking from the store to where the cars are at, the employee (not too sure what her tile was) had the car starting to cool off for us. After 20 minutes of showing us how some of the feature work, the key fob was given to me, and I have to say, what an impressive key fob, it is weighted and looks like the car very impressive. The first thing you notice when you settle into the car is how low it is and how long it is. The car had 21"" wheels so it rode a little on the rough side, and of course my tech geeky niece (she works for Sun Microsystems/Oracle) was playing with the center dash touch screen. As Sweeny said, Tesla could be (it really is) considered one of the best technological advanced companies ever. What can be said about elec motors that no one on this forum hasn't read about it, instead torque, scooting around traffic is not a problem, and if you drive it normal the car just purrs along. The car felt solid, but the closing of the doors didn't have the German feel when closing them. Leases are backed by Wells Fargo, and to lease this particular car it would have ran $1300/m with $7500 out of pocket, or purchase the car $1200/m with 10K down but with the 7500 federal tax credit really only 3K out of pocket. Tesla shows that one can build a pure elect car that is not boring and what the true cost of the car is without being subsidized my the motor-company.  If I could convince myself to spend $1200/m for a car I would get one in a heart beat, I love the design and the 265 miles range is not a problem, and I'm seeing more and more charging stations then ever before.  With the Model X and E coming school and the price dropping, who knows I might have one. The model E is to start at about 45K.

Not too long back, I took out a new S6 and was smitten by the intoxicating power of the thing, as well as its ability to blend sportiness and luxury into one sweet, sophisticated and sporty package.  Another month, about, has passed with my S4 -- now at 17,300 miles.  And, while I am certain another wild drive in an S6 would have me again tumescent with desire for this $80K super-sedan, it's just too damn fat, too big in the overall scheme of things. What would be really to my tastes, with the benefit of hindsight now, would be a slightly larger S4 -- add about an inch or so to the wheelbase, make it another 3 or 4 db quieter and put the SQ5 engine in it (for the added torque, natch). Open it up just a smidge in size and power -- 333HP and 325 ft/lbs just are about at a point in the marketplace to require a bit of a bump northward.  Here we sit with no new 4's coming until 2016 MY and, if history repeats, no new S4 for at least another year (or two) beyond that.  Now, if someone wanted to provide me with a new S6 for a couple of years at no charge, well, you can be certain I would not re-gift it.  My comments pertaining to my opinion that the S4 will certainly require a power boost to remain competitive are a good example of ""situational velocitization"". That is what used to feel really quick and fast, well, feels simply ""normal"" these days.

3910,"October  6, 2014  4:24PM",markcincinnati," Here's my [generally in violent agreement] thought about that power figure, sween: Ever escalating abilities to get power, coupled with a market that seems to have an endless appetite for more power may well take the next S4 (not the RS4, the S4) to 400 HP. Yet, there may be good reasons NOT to go there. For instance, isn't it true that part of the cost of our auto-insurance is based on HP (not torque, HP)?  If my assumption on that matter is correct, perhaps AoA will lobby for whatever the next lower HP (below 400) is but press for more readily available torque. Economy and emissions, too, would have to be a consideration, no?  The current 3.0T in the S4 puts out a conservative 333HP and 325 pound feet. The beefed up version in the SQ5 adds 21HP (taking it to 354) and 21 pound feet (getting us to 346). The crank is a heavier duty part than in the S4 iteration and apparently the SQ5 engine is ""strong enough"" to be cranked to another like increase without breaking much, if any, of a sweat.  A new model S4 with 375HP and 367 pound feet might just be the Goldilocks answer (at least in the US). This would leave plenty of ""headroom"" for either a blown V8 or an even more tightly tuned V6 (T) to be fitted into an RS4 model. Indeed, based on what is easily do-able these days with plain ol' ""normal"" forced induction (super or turbo), twin-charging (super AND turbo) or other, ""compound induction"" derivatives, I wouldn't be shocked to ""hear-tell"" of an S4 with a 4 cylinder engine of some-kind or another, putting out an easy-peasy 350HP with gobs of low end torque, either.  Program note:  For reasons that would require at least two more paragraphs, I will tell you that I was cruising along at about 67 MPH on I-71 N (north of the I-275 interchange this Saturday PM last). I had the ""need"" to ""punch it"" -- and for the count of 1, 2, 3 floored the S4, cleared the incident, glanced at my digital read-out and found it reading 100. Under the circumstances (light traffic, four lanes heading north, etc), I was simply able to coast down to a relatively legal 68 without the need for the dampers. I realize the S6 seemed to do this exact same thing in what I ""recall"" as 1,2,3 -- the difference is that the S6 did so with practically zero drama. The S4 made all kinds of fun sounds as it made the jump to light speed.   Newer S4's will, due to market conditions, surely come with more grunt than current versions, but for the life of me, I find it difficult to imagine ever being able (or rarely so) to use such power.  1,2,3 -- the thing is like a freakin' sling-shot.

3940,"September 15, 2014  3:10AM",tlong,"I rented a BMW 328 last week while staying in Las Vegas.  In short, I was particularly underwhelmed by this car. This is coming from somebody who currently drives an '05 TL and previously had a 6 cylinder Audi A4.  The BMW was black and is gorgeous outside. I was a bit surprised at how low the roof is on this car - definitely not a lot of headroom.  Since it's a rental, I'll grant that this was probably a downmarket trim level vehicle. The seats were black and I'm not sure if they were leather or leatherette - I suspect the vinyl as they didn't have a leather smell. The seat bottoms were very flat with almost no bolstering. In general, although the car did have nav, I didn't feel the interior was very upmarket. Seemed pretty middling to me - not as cheap as entry-level cars, but certainly not luxe, either. The trunk is large laterally but is shallow.  The automated nanny behavior had me screaming thoughts of repair costs had I owned this car. The electronic shifter seemed more gimmicky than useful. The auto-engine shutoff was exactly as has been described here - unrefined and jerky on restart. Yes, you can disable it but you need to do that every time you get back in the car.  I thought the steering was a bit numb and vague on-center. The ride was decent but not that quiet. The engine was refined for a 4 but not all that smooth to me. I didn't push the car as I was in traffic, but this car firmly convinced me that I didn't want to pay north of $40K for a 3-series.",decent smooth shifter im comfort costs week either short screaming numercedes comfort feel 6 bolstering secadillac almost cheap every exacacuray push low vinyl although suspect rental electronic disable luxe shutoff thought 4 back behavior yes las useful performance certainly 3series need black pay didnt veefficiency jerky middling large audi autoperformance grant gorgeous bmw performance shallow last rented vague traffic trim entrylevel want described coming restart automated somebody roof thoughts 05 drives staying surprised ride quiet downmarket definitely since comforteaudie vehicle preaudiy firmly time outside steering get owned upmarket convinced trunk probably cars comfort nanny general oncenter sure particularly smell laterally bit ill headcomfort lot acura previously 40k north flat level gimmicky refined car maintenance unrefined console boconsolems currenacuray underwhelmed seemed

3946,"August 29, 2014  2:43AM",andres3," I finally stopped being cheap and hired the collision claims consultants that were recommended to me for a professional unbiased independent diminished value appraisal that finally happened mid-August. It refutes the DV appraisal Mercury (at fault insured's company) paid for where they claimed my car sustained no structural damage (what about pulling an upper right rail isn't structural)? claimed it could be a certified used Audi still (no dealer I talked to seems eager to Certify a $22K+ repair billed S4. Car Max saw bolts spun on the hood and fender and that was enough for them to only offer wholesale price at $37K. They claimed they'd wholesale it, but part of me thinks they'd turn around and list it for $10K more at $47K. Based on their ""outside the ballpark of reality"" DV report, Mercury only offered $1K for DV. They upped it to 1.5K in a fake attempt to settle the claim. I've now sent my demand based on a ""REAL"" report that seems to be in the ball park of reality at $8850 DV amount. Plus the $445 fee and the $2,400 for rental car and insurance deductible expenses. I know they only have a $10K pot to pay out, so I'll settle for $10K total. They just want to delay this claim forever, and their tactics to frustrate me worked. I should of hired this DV Appraisal company from the beginning; I was wasting time without their help. I now have 20 boiler plate letters to refute the predictable excuses and false claims/reasons they can't pay my demand. It's kind of hilarious the letters I received answer and refute some of the BS reasons I've already been given. Each letter gives them 15 days to respond in writing which is more than reasonable. I predict they will offer to split the difference between their $1K DV report and my 8.8K DV report. One of the 20 letters is ready to go on that excuse. Their report is just so inaccurate, and the CarMax appraisal will help show that if need be. Could take 4 to 5 more letters going back and forth before I get paid, or worst case scenario, I have to take them to small claims court for $10K. The thing is these letters help build a ""bad faith lawsuit/claim"" if they refuse to pay up, so maybe a lawyer would take my case at that point.

3953,"September  8, 2014  8:08PM",markcincinnati,"When I pulled up to the sidewalk and parked in the No Parking zone, the boys’ bicycles were on their kick stands under the porte cochère at the back of the public library where the night drop off for books and, in my case, DVD’s is located. The library wouldn’t be open for more than an hour, so I assumed the boys were just there to get out of the hot morning sun. I put the DVD’s into the slot, nodded at the boys and turned around heading back to my idling car. Just about when I got to the driver’s door, one of the boys said “How much did that [car] cost?” I replied, “How much do you think?” The young man and his friend yelled back in unison, “A lot!” I told them it cost about $57,000, and I heard oo’s and ah’s in response. I drove off, giving them a quick honk and a wave. What’s the point? The point is, I’ve been thinking, saying and writing about what I assumed is the pending death of the automobile as most of us here know and love it. I’ve been of that opinion because it seems to me that virtually anyone under the age of 35 (or maybe under-30) seems as if they could care less about cars beyond them being appliances or means to get from point-to-point. These “young people” wouldn’t or couldn’t talk about cars if you threatened them with pain and death, and wouldn’t even bother to feign interest to win the new not-yet-released iPhone 6, so little interest do these folks seem to have in cars. These two young men gave me hope! Now, I’ll bet when you and I were in our formative (‘tween through teen-age) years, we had but several topics we cared to opine about: Cars, Girls [or boys] and Sex. I my case, I was a budding audiophile, too, which kind of rounded out the whole emerging nerd stereotype. Had there been personal computers (of any stripe) or video games available (it was the early to mid-60’s and such tech had not yet been introduced to the mainstream market), I most certainly would’ve been into them; but instead I was into “stereo” in addition to cars, girls and sex (talking about sex, not actually having it, of course). So when I was with my buds, the topic was often the “cars we were gonna be driving” as soon as we turned 16. We were dreamers, of course – we, then, were the kids sitting at the library entrance (where else?) watching the guy drive up in his new 1965 Bonneville pillar-less four-door painted in dark blue metallic with a ton of chrome accents and shiny chrome hub-caps and big ol’ tires (white walls, of course). “Hey mister, how much did that thing cost?” The reply, at the time, was “About $4,000,” and of course we then obliged by making the same oo and ah sounds like the ones I heard the other morning. My overarching point to this erudite group of auto enthusiasts here at Edmunds is that I believe we are pretty much smitten with cars and everything to do with them – but that we’re also mostly predisposed to acquire one of these Premium (or near-premium) Class cars based on history, loyalty or perhaps even looks. I would submit if you’ve had more than one representative of the same brand (back to back), that your next car is perhaps pre-ordained to come from that manufacturer. Loyalty to a brand is – along with several other characteristics – another sign that you are passionate about cars. You’ve come to identify yourself with BMW’s (a quite common occurrence here in Cincinnati) – you are a “BMW guy”. My friend, now President of his second software company had an Acura when I met him. In our times in the car often driving from Cincinnati to Chicago or to Bowling Green (KY), he would go on and on about what I’m convinced must be the best car in the world – at least he certainly thought so: the BMW M5. This guy was about 10-years my junior. Thankfully he didn’t have to keep the Acura long – so less than a year after I met him he leased his first (of many) BMW’s – a 3-series. Followed by a 5, then a 7 then one of the “Z” car convertibles (he called that one Penis). I submit that most of us here are (or want to be) “XXX” guys (intended to be gender neutral, don’t you know). You’re a Mercedes maven, you’re a BMW bigot and I’m an Audi aficionado. No matter what “empirical” data is brought to bear, you’re sure your new IS 350 F-Sport is superior to that guy’s BMW 328 – after all, Car & Driver says so; and, you just know you can run circles around the Bimmer’s 4-cylinder, turbo and all. So it is with the foreknowledge that no matter how much evidence I can produce to the contrary, you will remain steadfast that your own sagacity has been validated and put on display for all to see by your choice of the latest and greatest Volvo S60 (or whatever). So where does that leave us? With hope, I hope. The upcoming generation still needs to ratchet up their passion for all things automotive – or we could be doomed to forever being but passengers in our autonomous vehicles. But, I think there is some evidence, not much, but a little, that there are kids who are just as interested in cars as they are video games, social media (and, hopefully, sex). There may be some hope, too, that those of “us” who may not as of yet yet been inculcated by a Brand of automobile, may find our personal automotive archetype and to coin a phrase, “Live long and prosper.” I’ll close by saying this: While I still remain convinced that the Audi S4 is the best representative of the Entry-level Luxury Performance Sedan (and for the money it damn well ought to be), I must say, after having visited the Acura dealer to “See what’s new,” that the new TLX SH-AWD in Advance trim (the one with the 6-cylinder), ought to be this category’s leader if “price” (MSRP) is factored in. If you haven’t checked out this exact configuration (I can’t offer the same praise for the lesser TLX’s), I urge you to do so before you spend one dime on a new ELLPS car – this thing (the 2015, to be clear) is IMPRESSIVE!

Well ""us"" -- and we know who we are -- killed (or at least put it on its death-bed) the stick shift. Now, of course that's only partially true -- at least if you even a tiny bit agree that the DSG (aka PDK) dual clutch 'automatic manual' transmission is (and I hate to say this) equal to or better than the best manual transmissions ever made. But so few of ""us"" actually have these marvelous inventions -- and, I'll wager, the number of folks with the excellent 8-speed automatics available is also still somewhat small. I can only sort of forgive YOU and hold my head up high with righteous indignation: Because god knows my wife and I did our parts to preserve the manual transmissions going so far as to custom order nearly 2-and-a-half-dozen German cars with stick shifts since 1977 (we finally quit this practice out of the sheer futility of the act when we realized that [most of] the rest of YOU -- overwhelmingly -- had given up on stick shifts years earlier). And, my wife was appalled to read some of lame excuses, most of them blaming ""the wife"" for her inability to pilot a car with a stick shift. Of course, there is always that nagging feeling that the mobile phone also played a big part in killing the stick shift; even today it seems I don't have enough digits to count the number of cars I see being driven down the road with the driver holding a cell phone to his or her ear. So what? I forgot to mention the ""phones in the ear"" (thus requiring one free hand) I am counting are for the drivers' of cars that I know have Bluetooth! These drivers should be forced to ride the bus for one-full-year or pay a 5-figure fine (or both). This morning, in fact, I saw a woman (phone in ear) in a very young Maserati (with temp tags it was so new) pulling into Starbucks. I could only wonder if she was going to attempt to be on the phone and drink coffee all the while driving in rush hour traffic here in River City. The point? Qwit yur complainin', for the Market has spoken. But this latest outrage -- autonomous driving (by 2016 no less) -- is, some will say, both inevitable and welcome. Perhaps. It is also inevitable that we will -- eventually -- run out of fossil fuel. But we're talking decades and decades if you believe many of the scholarly studies from think tanks like the Rand Corporation to name one. Mean time, WHO (among us) is asking for self-driving cars? I'd rather pay more taxes (and I can't believe I said that) if some of them could be earmarked for public transportation infrastructure improvements and additions. A one-person (or 4 person) public transportation vehicle (manifested in the form of a self-driving passenger vehicle), is not something I want to sign up for. On the other hand, I do want driver aids: laser headlights, night-vision, ""city safety"", all around-view cameras, rear cross traffic alerts -- even automatic cruise control for those 100+ mile stints behind the wheel that are part of my weekly routine trips between Cincinnati and Columbus or Cincinnati and Louisville or Indianapolis. I want a connected car (better even than that which is in my 2014 S4: ""Audi Connect""), but I still want to press the pedals (most of the time, anyway) and turn the steering wheel myself. I am [now, happily] resigned to allowing my dual-clutch 7-speed automatic manual transmission to do the rowing for me, but I am far, far, far from wanting my car to drive itself. Indeed, I'm mostly sure I don't even want the thing to park itself, thank you very much. The only good news in the Nissan announcements (if you can call it ""good"") is that Nissan claims they will NOT ELIMINATE the need for human interaction (like some competitors -- gulp). ""There is no need to sally forth, for it remains true that those things which make us human are, curiously enough, always close at hand.

3996,"August 27, 2014  9:29PM",markcincinnati,"I think virtually the entire in-car ""avionics"" or ""carvionics"" should be able to be updated by BlueTooth streaming from (why not) a smart phone. New features and functions could be loaded into the dash's brain just like an app can be downloaded into your smartphone. Certain things, I'm sure, would require hardware upgrades, but heck, make everything a module (as if it isn't already in a lot of cases) that could be plucked out like a radio head unit and replaced with new technology. And, why not make things at least one, if not more generations backwardly compatible (with some loss of functionality). Right now I want to update (replace actually) that piece of crap Audi Connect ""hardware"" that apparently, forces me to have but ONE choice, other than to go without -- T-Mobile. I go less than 5 miles and the connection drops to 2G, which totally kills Google Maps and the eye in the sky-view on the screen. Even 3G isn't all that great. Yet, right there, on the showroom floor is an A3 with 4G LTE -- which is pretty much like being there (and the carrier is AT&T which works about 98% of the time compared with T-Mobile's 70% of the time.) There must be a ""module"" under the dash that is nothing more than a ""smart phone"" without the phone case. Or, why not allow the ""phone"" to be ""unlocked"" and allow, via software, me to use another, more reliable carrier. Heck, for all I know T-Mobile is great (just not in Ohio), elsewhere. Update-able tech, that's what's next -- or at least it should be. Of course, I think EVERYTHING should be standard on the car as it comes from the factory. Then, if you want the option, you pay for it -- you don't get rid of the car. This could even be done for many engine performance enhancements -- base cars comes with 200HP and 200 ft/lbs of torque. Pay the man (the dealer) to turn on the next level up the performance ladder and the engine now cranks out 250HP and 275 ft/lbs., etc etc. I'm not suggesting a basic BMW 3-series come to market equipped with a software hobbled M3 powerplant -- awaiting someone to pay for the upgrade to have the secret code entered.

3997,"August 28, 2014  2:06AM",andys120,"Our Epic ELLPC Road Trip My wife and I recently completed an extensive motor tour of the Intermountain West in our 2001 BMW 330 Ci Cabriolet. Sometimes in this topic we lose sight of the fact that these cars aren't just about high tech features and luxury appointments, they're about enjoying driving . I thought I'd give you some impressions about what it's like to take one of these ELLP cars on an extensive road trip. I'm not going to give you a travelogue of what we saw and did but talk about the journey, which, if you love to drive, is as important as the destinations. I'm well aware that the convertible version of the Three Series isn't the sort of vehicle most would choose for such a trip, in fact the default choice for such long-distance touring is a motor home/RV or Fifth-wheel trailer. I understand the appeal of such vehicles but pros get paid good money for driving large heavy vehicles because driving them is a chore, at least IMO. If you love driving and haven't driven in the Far West you should put it on your bucket list. You can really drive out there, speed limits are high and traffic enforcement is light. The roads (with some notable exceptions*) are in beautiful shape and even the Interstates have dramatic curves, steep grades (up to 7%!) and the most spectacular scenery you'll see anywhere. Our 14 year old Bimmer performed beautifully without any problems other than a healthy appetite for 91 Octane (we averaged 28 MPG) and took to the highway as an autobahn-bred car should. We always had more than enough power and brakes to handle anything and the sublime steering made every mile a pleasure. The major drawback of course was the small size, it wouldn't be suitable for more than two on such a long trip. We took advantage of the feature that allows one to flip away the recess where the top goes when it's down which greatly increased luggage space but robbed us of the ability to cruise topless until had we offloaded the bags. I've been a convertible guy for a long time but I wouldn't care to go more than two or three hours w the top lowered anyway. Thanks to the well-designed top, the Three-er Cabrio makes a very nice Grand Touring coupe w the top in place . After 20 days, 4500 miles and 8 states (AZ/UT/ID/OR/MT/WY/NV) we arrived home tired but satisfied after a great drive in a wonderful car. *Western roads are generally in fine shape with a couple of notable exceptions (mostly in Montana and I-40 in Western AZ is surprisingly bad give the state's rep for good roads) but they are littered with ""Road Alligators"", shreds of truck tires, one of which tore up the lower front grille and left side fog light. This is surprising in light of the proliferation of truck inspection stations.

The service manager's good will was somewhat offset by the wag of the computer's finger. I had no expectation of free wipers, but appreciate them, since I replace them every 15K as a matter of routine. Typical to the Audi powerplants, I am now enjoying the 10,000+ mile break in surge of power.

Of course the 19"" wheels sure are purty. The trim on the dash, doors etc, can be had in 3 flavors, look at examples of each, then decide. Paint is expensive -- if on a budget (what am I saying) get one of the free colors. The video reviews and Motor Trend says 0-60 4.4 sec.

4029,"August 26, 2014  2:27PM",markcincinnati,"Personal Preference Speaking Here: I do I do I do really like the A6 family (espcially the S6) -- the current A6 is, IMNSHO, a looker from the outside and MOSTLY on the inside. A few years ago, pre-widespread implementation of nav systems in the LPS and ELLPS classes, Pioneer electronics offered a replacement head-unit for many cars, Audi being among them. The thing looked pretty standard, seemed to fit in nicely with the rest of the car (this was back in the days when Audi cars came with Blaupunkt head-unit systems), at least as nicely as the Audi OEM units. The Pioneer solution included sat nav. The way it worked was to seemingly eject a rectangular panel horizontally and then articulate the panel (the screen), by 90 degrees. At the time, I thought, ""Gawd that looks soo after-market"" -- they (meaning Audi) need to inegrate the navi screen into the dash, not copy this fugly looking contraption. Once Audi abandoned the very small navi screen between the tach and speedo and went with a 7"" widescreen aspect ratio built into the dash, I thought we'd taken a big step forward in interior design. BTW, why buy one of these $50K cars without navi, etc and smack a Tom Tom or Garmin unit onto a patch of Velcro every-time you get in the car? Or even more inexplicable, why buy one of these high-buck cars without nav and then spend a king or queen's ransom to retro-fit the OEM nav system (literally for double the cost of getting it on the car in the first place)? Virtually all the car-buff magazines agreed -- for years and years -- ""No one does interiors better than Audi."" I got my 2005 A6 with all options, meaning the built in screen was present and accounted for, acting as my navi screen, as well as radio screen, telephone screen, etc etc etc. As an aside -- I've had BlueTooth for 10+ years and I saw a Honda commercial last night on TV where you'da thunk the new 2015 Honda Civic ""now with bluetooth"" was making some cutting edge revelation. What's that about? I mean, seriously, I've had bluetooth for over 10-years and it is being touted as some great new feature that should make you want to consider a new Honda ""as if"" the thing is a leader in Automotive Electronics. My 2009 A4 had an upgraded and improved version of the 2005 A6 dash and, of course, added a back-up camera (which didn't come to the A6 until the 2006 model year). Don't get me started again on Honda's cutting-edge inclusion of a back up camera on a 2015 car ""as if"" it was the second coming! Then, I start looking at the new A6's that came into the showroom in 2012 and they had that damn Pioneer aftermarket screen protruding out and up EVERY time you started the car. The salesperson says ""OK, if you don't like it, you can push a button to keep it hidden."" Sure you can, but you'll miss radio info, telephone info and also other key information that is displayed and is to be acted upon from time to time -- so, you can't really keep that stick-em-up screen hidden since it is one of your key components for management of some of the cars systems. That damn pop-up aftermarket looking thing was/is one of my pet peeves about the then (2012) current CTS -- but at least Cadillac had some of the data visible when the screen was in its retracted position. It looks even worse on the A3, since the dash is soo plain (barren from the middle to the passenger side, really.) The Macan, TODAY, has taken over for the best NEW dash, if you axe me. Audi needs to get rid of that protuberance in the A6 and A3 right away, like NOW. The A4 and A5 (for 2015) dash may be a bit dated, but it is crisp and clean compared to what seems to pass these days as modernistic. Audi, look at the Macan's dash from the perspective of a front seat occupant -- that should be YOUR dash-look. ""You cursed brat! Look what you've done! I'm melting! melting! Oh, what a world! What a world ..."" What time is it now? Oh who cares -- it must be 5 o'clock SOMEWHERE. Anyone care to join me?

4052,"August 18, 2014  1:11PM",graphicguy," Robr2....yes, all true. Bought it outside the servicing dealers' territory. Bought in Chicago....serviced in Cincinnati. I saved $4K on the car by doing that. Plus, the selling dealer went to great legnths explaining to me how Audi values me as a customer, and that warranty work/service would gladly be done at an Audi dealer in the country. I've bought enough cars to understand what happened. You're probably right. There was a rep who was operating with the idea that the car was bought outside his territory (not totally sure about that though, given Audi has a Central Region based out of Chicago...not sure if OH is included in that). However, that's a case of not seeing the forrest for the trees. They acknowledged there was a problem. They said Audi had a fix. They never did, or if they did, it didn't work. The local dealerships (Audi recommended I try both) diagnosed it the same way. Both said it was a problem. No one could or would fix it. There were other issues with the car, however....not just the Quattro binding. At one point, the Audi Customer Service Rep even said that I was having it serviced at a dealer that I didn't buy it from, and that could be an issue. I've always thought that, but that's the first time I heard an actual manufacturer's representative admit it. That said, I would imagine this does happen. There has to be a procedure to account for this....some sort of a paper trail to account for something like this. So, you go to Audi, with them telling you they don't care where you buy their cars, as long as you buy them. But, in reality, at least in my case, unless you buy it from the dealership closest to you, geographically, you might have some issues getting the car fixed.

4063,"August 12, 2014  9:12PM",markcincinnati,"My point regarding the new A3/S3 (which I have not driven, but have sat in) is that it will ""force"" the A4/S4 to move upscale in terms of luxury and it will also get more power so that the S3 will not be quicker than an S4. The basis for my comments is the new C&D article where C&D says the S3 makes the S4 irrelevant or something akin to that. I have not seen the S3 yet -- but the A3 would probably receive the same comments -- this time aimed at the A4 -- from the author of the C&D piece on the S3. If you accept that as having some truth to it, it would seem that Audi will be forced to do something to keep the A3/S3 from siphoning off customers from the A4/S4. Many folks buy/lease these cars and only the front seats see much adult duty -- the rear seats may be used by an adult, but probably only rarely. I think the A4/S4 is a bit cramped in the back seat -- so the A3, of course, must be quite cramped. But, who cares if 95% of the time it is a driver and maybe a front seat passenger. Even those who take their colleagues to lunch probably would find no issue with the A3 for the often short drive from the office to the lunch wagon. What could the A4/S4 do -- add performance and/or add luxury -- and being that you're Audi, you would probably err on the side of adding lux first, performance second (my point about the S6 is that it is a far more ""muted"" sporting vehicle, emphasizing luxury first -- even though it IS a screamer performance wise.) The 2016 A4 line will -- if history repeats -- not offer up an S4, rather that will come in MY 2017. But, even the A4 vs the A3 will have the A4 needing to be different enough from the A3 to justify the price. Size of the wheelbase, length, width, etc, alone is (and I'm with C&D here) will not be enough to make the choice clear between the two -- the A4 will have to lead with more ""stuff"" more lux stuff and more performance than the A3 at any one point in time. Perhaps, the 2015 S4 will be more heavily discounted due to the birth of the S3 in the US next month -- get 'em while their hot for about a year. I may be wrong throwing my lot in with C&D, but I just can't see what the A4/S4 development team has as an alternative to the A3/S3 but to take the A4/S4 upstream, so to speak. Please make your argument to the contrary, I would really love to think the A4 family can and will hold its own, will be differentiated sufficiently from the A3 to keep the A4 sales on an upward trajectory. I just don't see any alternative for the A4 but to head for the top (of course this will likely mean a stupid price delta will ""erupt"" between the cars -- something like I was lamenting regarding the price difference between an S4 and an S6.)",console point 2015 irrelevant force comfort think month team dont youre im accept front development short sufficienacuray rather difference alone history could performanceing comments take head em keep secadillac quicker author folks 95 wrong next regarding birth contrary upscale stylingbase driven receive sales lead justify due seem really see back side audi4 piece many much stuff akin trajectory erupt buylease cares line lux performance maybe audi basis stupid must rarely even muted repecadillac drive discounted offer alternative terms new love hold upstream customers vs family lenfordh please upward makes eperformanceasizing yet adult far width two make mean come top audi3 may often add likely sat though aimed us first passenger lunch differentiated wise second year used adding vehicle time truth would different perhaps err get price lamenting 2016 office speak argument seen cant article course hot probably cars comfort etc performance find needing heavily throwing bit rear issue screamer wagon siphoning something lot quite andor move 2017 says choice one clear consoleodgeped driver like also enough delta size duty colleagues forced

4088,"August 16, 2014  4:37PM",graphicguy,"OK....for no other reason than I'm interested in a lot of diffrent cars, and I MAY BE in the market in the next 24 months, AND I was in close proximity to both a Lexus and an Infiniti dealer last night after work, I did some test driving. This is hot on the heals of doing the BMW drive event. I like BMWs. I wanted to drive the M235i, but they didn't have any to test drive....only 4 series. 435i xDrive, with sport pack? Yep....I'll take two. Problem is, I think BMW has now started to believe their own marketing hype. And, they've priced themselves accordingly. Not sure you get anything more than what I got from my former E92.... less, actually. But, there's been a definite rise in price while staying the same or getting worse in some areas (steering being the most obvious). High $50s? Low $60s? Sorry I'll drop out of that market. Some will walk into their local BMW store with $60K burning a hole in their pocket for a 3/4 series not knowing what else they could get for that kind of money. I'm sure they aren't going to miss me, though. They're doing fine without me. Infiniti Q50.......drove an AWD version with sport wheels and supposedly sport suspension. It was either too soft, wandering, needing constant minute corrections to stay straight, or doing the same thing, with much higher effort involved. Electronics feels like a cold Windows 3.1 boot up. $50K? I'll take the highly discounted G37x Sport for $10K+ less. Not bad looking, mind you. Just not my cup of tea (yet again). Lexus....IS350 F Sport. Tried to buy one when they first came out. Dealer didn't want to deal, so no dice. Now, they're ready to deal I see why the trade rags have rated this car higher than the 3 series. The grill is a love it-hate it affair. I'm used to that (with my TL), though. Drive it as fast as you want, however you want, wherever you want. Very nicely weighted steering. Really fine handling/ride feel. As is typical for Lexus, very good materials and build quialty. The one I drove was $49K, pretty loaded up with Nav, leather, sunroof, etc. Probably the prettiest grey paint job I've seen on any car (Nebula Grey). Out of the shoot, sales manager (who introduced himself after the test drive was over), said the IS I drove would be in the $47K range (maybe get serious in the $45K-$46K range?). If/when I get ready to buy, I'll come back to give them a shot at my business. Once again, the 3/4 Series are nice cars. The IS350 is better, for significantly less money. I informed all the dealers I was not in the market. This is the difference between high end dealerships and the ones that know at some point they want you back into their store. They'll acknowledge you're ""just looking"" and offer to be there when you're ready.

4110,"August 11, 2014  9:26PM",markcincinnati,"I Never Would Have Thought of This Outcome: I wouldn’t want you to think that I take advantage of my Audi dealer’s willingness to throw me the keys to a new A3, A6, A7, Q5, Q7, S4, SQ5, S6 or TT (who me?!) – I’ve not really been interested in driving an A8 and the S8’s and R8’s are almost always “sold cars,” besides since my dealer knows when either my wife or I am “in the market,” I’d hate to push it by putting them in the position of having to say “no” especially since we’ve only had our 2014 “S” Audis for months, not years. It was with the full understanding that we are not currently in the market that my wife and I decided that Saturday last was the day we would test drive a new Audi. We thought long and hard about taking a test drive of either a 2014 A6 3.0T or a 2015 A6 2.0T with the sport package and lots of options. Both of these cars were on the lot and not “sold” cars. My wife asked me what I really, really wanted to drive, now, if I could only drive one car, I immediately answered a new “S6” – that was easy. A few minutes after walking in the showroom door, we were handed the keys to a 2014 S6 with about 300 miles on the OD and with a few choice options: cold weather package, black wood and aluminum trim, black interior and panther black exterior. Also present: 20” wheel upgrade (from the standard 19” inchers). Since the designation of the S6’s is now Prestige, there were very few features the car didn’t have – it did not have the top view camera for example, or the automatic cruise control including stop and go, etc. To my eye, I sat down, behind the wheel of The Batmobile (the color combo having a lot to do with that) and pressed the start button only to be immediately more than a little impressed by the “awakening.” Unfortunately, this car was an S6, not an S5, RS5 or even S4. I say unfortunately because the car was clearly focused 90% on the luxury side of sport-luxury. This became even more evident when I put the car into drive (which means “S” or sport mode since I had set the steering and air suspension to Dynamic (along with the engine and transmission) using Audi-Drive-Select. I ultimately changed the steering to Auto mode which gives the car super easy turns at slow speed, but tightens things up considerably as the MPHs climb. Speaking of climbing, I got onto a nearby Interstate (I-275 by-pass, eastbound) and was cruising along at a steady 60MPH – when all of a sudden, I floored the S6 and counted to three (one, two, three) – I counted pretty quickly too -- certainly 1, 2, 3! (think Sia) -- in less than three seconds. I released the accelerator completely and looked down at the speedometer only to see an indicated 102MPH. The sensation I had was, well, muted, subdued, suppressed – sublime. There was virtually no drama, barely any sound (angry engine or otherwise) lingered at all, and I was coasting down but still showing an indicated 90+-something on the speedo. What did I do next? Well, I “punched” the accelerator pedal for another Sia-like one-two-three moment, signaled right for the rapidly rushing at me exit ramp, hit the ramp at incredible speed, barely “mashed” the brake pedal only to get a momentary sensation that the S6 had impossibly instantaneously scrubbed off about 80 miles per hour (and almost magically seemed to be going backwards the descent was that swift) as I damn near just coasted to a stop as if nothing had happened 1-second ago. Meanwhile, I awaited the traffic-light to glow green. I tried out the S6’s handling envelope using my completely accurate and totally made up (therefore unscientific) routine of driving faster and faster and faster in a circle, then carving through an imaginary slalom barely nicking those [also imaginary] orange cones. The thing carves like a hot knife through buttah! A little, not much, body roll – but hey, this thing is a full-sized vehicle, remember. Here’s the thing, after my test drive – during which time I became thoroughly smitten – I drove (in sequence) our 2014 SQ5 and next up our 2014 S4. Now, I read the mfgr’s published 0-60 numbers for all three of these “S” vehicles, and the S6 is, after all, the quickest of the three, on-paper. The thing is my $58,000 S4 is very quiet, too, and I have the upgraded seats (which certainly seem very similar to the S6’s) further blurring the differences -- between the S4 and S6. My B&O sound system edges out the S6’s Bose system by a small but discernable difference, especially in the clarity department – the B&O tweeters are really impressive, the Bose’s less so. The S6 however, commands, no, demands your attention – much more so than the Ibis White S4, which seems to have a bit less “presence” than the Panther Black S6. Regarding the S6: I want one, I want one, I want one – and for perhaps $68-$70,000 (as equipped), I would actually say the value is really there. The thing is, however, the bottom line on the sticker was $79,500+. It (the S6) just didn’t seem to be THAT much more car, even though it would be worth considering hocking the family jewels and taking out a second mortgage.

The article opens and closes suggesting that the S3 will cannibalize sales from the S4. After reading the review, I would mostly agree -- but, as the S6 is to the S4 (that is to say way more luxurious but with plenty of go and stop talent), I would think the next S4 we will get will distance itself from the S3 by virtue of great gobs of power (instead of 333HP, how about 395 -- 100 more than the S3 as a nice round number?) and even more luxury bits and pieces. I mean the new S4 has to have (or be) a step up either in performance or luxury or both -- and Audi probably will go with a decent power upgrade over the current S4, but likely will go with a huge dollop of lux given the brand's positioning. Perhaps if there is an RS4, there will be great gobs of new power and large lumps of added luxury. I mean, really, other than the satisfaction of knowing you're in an S4 (and paid more), C&D is right, for most folks the S3 will be the one to asipire to. My gawd, the S3 can be had for the price of an A4 -- and only loose a bit of trunk space and rear leg room. Most folks here will drive the car solo or have but one front-seat adult passenger. The only thing lacking from the new S3 is the torque vectoring rear diff. Wouldn't surprise me if they figured out how to do that within a model year or so. One last thing, a prediction: Given my recent S6 test drive: the new S6, whenever that comes out, will loose 2 more pistons, but manage to have more power and get better mileage and with it being a V6, the car will be less nose heavy, improving its handling performance.",round satisfaction point console talent 100 comfort decent think surprise within youre review plenty either added say gobs manage loose brands 395 knowing almost great huge folks next solo leg brand efficiency sales lumps positioning really asipire cannibalize dollop closes whenever performance stop recent lux large performance audi test nice opens space performance comfort even step drive prediction new right last gperformance improving vectoring family adult heavy less distance mean pieces likely instead passenger agree year would perhaps nose performance get diff price lacking comfort frontcomfort mosacuray pistons figured trunk virtue article way wouldnt probably 333performance paid performance numercedeser bit rear current ought go beaudier one driver bits upgrade thing tests reading car 2 given comes suggesting ellps

Driving one, if your priority is not stop light wars, but a well made, good handling car, the 320i offers all those attributes. Gotta say, you get a car that if you're careful with the options list, for mid-high $30s, that you don't have to worry about, at all, for anything, for 4 years, that's appealing. Lots of reviews coming in for the TLS. Seems as if the press cars have some sort of glitch where there's some hesitation coming off the line when you first hit the gas. I didn't experience that. Both the 4 and 6 cvl pulled strongly at throttle tip in. I estimate 0-60 in the low 5 sec range, add a second to that for the 4 cyl. Are they the fastest? No. But, they will be competitive to an ATS or CTS, A4, A6 (4 cyl), Infiniti Q (pick one), Lexus IS/ES. Unless you go to a blown V6 (like in the S4/A6) or turbo'd BMW motors (at much higher cost), you'll be right in line with the field. And, you'll have to climb the price ladder quite a bit to really get significantly better performance. But, the suspension is where the car really shines. It feels as sophisticated as anything I've ever driven. It trumps BMW and BMW's own game. Ride/handling is superb. Acuras are notorious for holding great resale. I can see this trend continuing. It is now back on top the tech heap, too. Good looking interior with high quality build and materials. In short, it feels much more expensive than it is.

4130,"August  6, 2014  5:03PM",flightnurse," BMW has gotten a bad rap on the suspension/handling of the F30 and F10 cars but there is a easy fix to this, order the Dynamic Handling Package (DHP in BMW language) cost $1,400. BMW in the past had been criticized on how ""harsh"" it's ride was, so for the F30 they went a little softer (more on this) however, DHP allows BMW to have the best of both worlds, creating a softer ride and keeping the sporting handling. Graphic I'm surprised that the 4 series you drove did not have this. The only F30 not to get DHP is the 320, but this will change, the sales of 320i have exceeded BMW sale projection and for 2015 new options and color choices will be available to it. My BMW dealer will be hosting their Ultimate Driving Experience here in the next week, I have reserved 3 cars, M235i, 428 Grand Coupe and 5 series Activehybrid. Now regarding the F30 and it's soft ride, in our house we have a unique chance of driving two cars from two different mind sets. Ricks Genesis and my 320i. I think Rick has enough seat time in both cars to see first hand the difference between them. Latley, I would say the last 3 months Rick has been driving my car a little more and he is picking me up at the airport in it, he tells me the ride in my 320 had a better feel, a more ""planted"" feel on the road and the ride is more controlled then his Genesis also Rick says the steering has better feel.",bmwi 2015 driving ricks litacurae think bad im graphic available criticized week bmw35i difference chance say easy feel performanceing performanceperformance road activehybrid next styling dealer past regarding 1400 sales exceeded 4 see months language projection hand however coupe cost went nissante 428 planted bmw worlds 3 new last goaudien picking order two allows rap surprised ride house hyundai first tells reserved harsh keeping choices 5 time mind steering would performance different get series hosting soft softer options drove rick controlled aspiration sale cars comfort creating package unique change dperformance fix grand sets experience airport beaudier says laacuraey dynamic also enough car

They all make the point that plopping in a 328/335 similarly equipped with similar performance is going to run way up the price scale. And, as was pointed out, like Audi and BMW, Acura's style is evolutionary, not revolutionary. As previously mentioned, I want to hold onto my TL SH AWD at least until the warranty is up....which won't be for another couple of years. As it stands, I've had two oil changes and two tire rotations in 17,000 miles. That's it. I think maintenance has cost me about $140 in the 1.5 years I've had it.

4169,"August  5, 2014  3:50AM",graphicguy,"Stick....thanks. Get this out of the way up front, The TLX looks much better in person than the pics I've seen. Dealer had two cars....one black with a sweet dark saddle interior. i really like that combo. The other one was white with black interior. The interiors are a big upgrade over mine, and pretty much turns it into a leader in the segment. All controls move with precision and smoothness that lead the pack. The 4 has an 8 speed, dual clutch trans. Fun drive. The DCT performs extremely well. Steering is light, and precise. It tightens up well as you gain speed....very linear. Gun it, and it leaps. Quick, firm shifts with ""blip"" matching revs. It's as roomy inside as my TL. They say it has shorter front and rear overhangs. Maybe. Not sure. Plenty of rear seat room. Seat of pants tells me 0-60 around 6-6.5 secs. Leather is good...better than the fake stuff other brands tout. Better than most premium leathers in other premium brands. Dual screens...top one for NAV. Bottom one for audio and HVAC. This car will compete well with 4 cyl A4s, 320/8i, C300 4 cyl. The V6 was a FWD Advance. It was as loaded as any car I've ever driven. 9 speed push button trans. It's always in the right gear and will run to redline in every gear. It will snap to any gear firmly....right now! Great seats, very high quality materials. Super quiet. Again...steering was light but tightened up at speed. Suspension is really refined and sophisticated...comparable to a much more expensive car. Nothing seems to upset it....and I tried. I expect 0-60 to be in the low to mid 5s. Like the 4, it loves to run and sounds/feels smooth, typical Acura motors. These just seem to want run hard. P-AWS is slick....you point.....it goes...no drama, understeer well controlled....as fast as you dare to go. I saw the MSRP of the V6 Advance.....~$42K. Not sure about the 4 cyl. That includes the ELS surround system (best I've heard in a car), lane keeping, intelligent cruise, sunroof, really nice leather, remote start...everything. A BMW 3 or 4, A/S4, C class would easily cost an extra $10K to $15K for something similar. Dealer said Acura is giving $1,500 discount and $500 in ""add-ons"" for anyone trading an '08 on up.

4172,"August  5, 2014  5:46PM",benjaminh,"Accord EXL Navi vs. Acura TLX Tech Since I love having built-in navi, this will be a comparison of the Accord EXL Navi ($30,835) with the Acura TLX with Tech Package ($35,025), and so we're looking at a difference of $5k. We all know that to get a good discount on a TLX anything close to what you can get on the Accord you'd need to wait c. 4-6 months for production to ramp up. But I can wait. My 2008 Accord EXL navi 5MT is working quite well, and is still under the HondaCare warranty all the way until Jan. of 2016. Here's my very subjective evaluation of what each feature of the TLX might be ""worth"" to me personally, compared to an Accord EXL navi. I admit, I haven't yet been in the car, but I do trust Honda/Acura to create a good quality product, since I've owned 3 Accords and had good experiences with all of them.... 8-speed dual-clutch transmission compared to CVT: $1000 206 hp engine compared to 185 for the Accord: $600 PAWS precision all-wheel steering: $600 larger performance tires/better alloy wheels: $600 Upgraded brakes (320mm vs. 292mm): $400 440-watt ELS Studio surround 10-speaker: $800 JewelEye LED headlights $300 60/40 split fold down seats: $300 Premium interior including Milano leather: $800 Very nice exterior+structural upgrades: $800 longer warranty: $400 tilt down mirrors: $200 paddle shifters: $300 Real Time Traffic: $200 Rain sensing wipers: $200 Blind Spot Info system: $300 Lane Keeping Assist: $300 Rear Cross Traffic Monitor: $300 Driver's side Knee airbag: $300 Integrated Dynamic System (Econ, Normal, Sport, Sport +): $400 -$600 for LaneWatch which comes with the Accord but not on the Acura. Some of this stuff I have no idea if I'd like. Lane Keeping Assist? I hope I pay attention and drive for myself (wish everyone would hang-up and drive), but maybe useful....? Rain sensing wipers? Surely I'm not so lazy or blind that I can't turn the wipers on?? So I didn't put much down for those. I imagine an Acura engineer looking at how much time and $ it cost for them to put that in would be annoyed at me. But a great sound system like the award-winning ELS set-up is worth a lot to me. Quite possibly I'm still missing some things. But anyway, admitting that this is very subjective and a total guess (since I haven't yet driven a TLX), but based on the strong reviews, as well as my strong trust in Honda/Acura this upgrade to the TLX seems to be ""worth it"" to me. In fact, it seems to add up to: c. $8500 or so imaginary dollars of ""worth it"" to me for a c. 5k price.

4202,"July 30, 2014  3:09PM",graphicguy,"So, last weekend, by invite, I went to the BMW drive event at my local BMW dealer. Always a fun event. For those unfamiliar with it, BMW, through the local dealer, allows you to drive their cars, and the competitors' models, back-to-back. I chose the 435i xDrive, as that is the successor to my beloved former 335ix coupe (E82). Total redesign....interior and exterior. As best as I could tell, the drivetrain is a little ""tamer"" in the 435. But, that could be because I had a performance package on my former coupe. Still, these are Bavarian muscle cars. The uncommunicative steering was the most noticeable. It's not that the steering wasn't up to the chore of spirited driving. It's that you were never sure if it could do what you asked it to do. You pointed it, and the car followed, but I was never sure it would. Maybe with time and experience, you get used to it. I preferred the steering in my E92. The other big complaint is that people felt they made the suspension to soft. I don't get that. I think the suspension is a worthy upgrade to the suspension in the E92. It soaks up broken pavement better, even at speed, without unduly upsetting the cabin. Not a huge difference over the E92 mind you. But, a worthy one. I liked it. The new 4 is definitely bigger than my previous 3. I liked my E92. I like the F32, I think. It definitely has more ""creases"" (my technical term). Headlights are the same with the BMW ""ring"" DRLs. Plenty of room. My tester did not have the sports seats. Coming from the sports seats in my TL SH AWD (which are some of the best in the biz, IMHO), this was immediately noticeable. Wasn't a fan of them in my E92. Still not a fan of the standard seats in the F32. Nice dash with color heads up display.....EXCEPT.....the display disappears when wearing sun glasses. Usually BMW thinks these types of things through. This time they failed. Kind of defeats the purpose of a HUD if you can see it only on overcast days. Whose idea was it to make that auto shifter so convoluted? It's a beer tap looking thingy. In unfortunate BMW fashion, instead of just putting it in ""D"" or ""R"" depending on what you want, you push a button, pull a lever, do this, do that, just to put it in gear. Why make something so simple, so complex? Stereo was the standard one. I had the HK in my E92. The standard stereo is worse than the HK. The HK wasn't all that great to begin with. Neither is all that good compared to the one in my TL (ELS)....not even close. The iDrive has evolved. It only took BMW over a decade to get it to a reasonable level of operation and ease of use. But, it's now good. You can write on the top of the little dial between the seats to input a letter. Not so good while driving. A little better when stopped. Not nearly as good as the same Audi technology on the A6 w/Nav. As has been mentioned before, the NAV screen looked like an afterthought. The ""start/stop"" technology seems a bit smoother than the last one I drive in a 4 cal 328i. Still needs work, though. Usually I don't sit in the back seat, particularly in a coupe. I tried it out with the 4, though. Entrance and exit weren't bad, given the (slow) electric seats that will move out of the way. But, if you're looking for cost cutting, this is where you'll find it. Back seat was filled with hard plastics that sounded very ""cheap"" when you knocked on them. All-in-all, still drives like a BMW. Offers good handling, and decent comfort, all while going fast.....very fast. On a tech note, BMW has joined those in the top tier. iDrive is good and offers everything you could want and is relatively easy to use. If you want the ""snob"" appeal, the BMW muscle car feel, the maintenance and warranty that covers practically everything, and the uber good BMW dealership experience where they take care of everything for you, this is your choice. At a price, that is. My tester had an MSRP of $57K. For that kind of money (and for a whole lot less), you can find other cars that are just as good, if not better. Still, I have a soft spot for the 3 series (now the 4). They do a whole lot really, really well. The dealer experience is superlative. I know they are the car to lease vs buy.

4205,"July 30, 2014  6:39PM",graphicguy,"Mr Shiftwright.....the Benz C350 4matic wasn't a car I expected to like, but surprisingly did. Probably not a good thing for a BMW comparison drive event. I just went with my sister to help her buy a C300 4Matic sedan. The coupe felt like a different car. The engine was stronger than the C300. It gave up some power to the really excellent twin scroll turbo 6 in the 335i. But, in the Benz, the 3.5L felt quick, I'd dare to say, fast enough (about the same as my seat of the pants feel in my TL). It was smooth. I think it may have had ""start/stop"" technology. But, compared to the BMW's implementation, it was so hard to tell, it might not have. Just goes to show what a little better engineering for something like that can achieve. The C, while entertaining to drive, seemed more relaxed in doing it than the BMW. Granted, the BMW was probably better when driving at 10/10ths. The Benz felt better everywhere else in the driving experience. The Benz was easier to drive fast than the BMW. I'd say that's true of the Benz over my previous S4, too. It's not as fast on an absolute basis. But, it's easier to drive fast in every day driving. The suspension really did offer a good ride/handling feel....very well sorted, with a premium ride that not so much isolated you, but made it so you really didn't care of there was broken pavement underneath you. It stayed eminently composed while not doing anything untoward while traveling around corners and/or over bad pavement. Materials.....very nice. The one I drove had leather......good leather....extra cost leather. Seats were better than in the BMW, but still not quite as good as in the TL. Same goes for the stereo (H/K, again). Not bad, but not nearly as good as the ELS in the Acura. All the other materials, and their execution/build, etc were a ⅓ step above the BMW. Very nicely done...felt expensive....even the way the dials worked. Where it falls down...who in the world designed the cruise/turn signals? How can you use one without engaging the other. They're both on the same side of the steering wheel, in the same vicinity. Somebody at Mercedes needs to lose their job over that design faux pas. The nav and knob system felt a couple of generations behind BMW's iDrive or the Nav/buttons in my Acura. The Mercedes took forever to boot up. Once it did, it seems it took multiple inputs to do even the simplest tasks. Whereas you could find areas of cost cutting in the BMW, you found no such items anywhere in the Benz. Everything looked, felt and functioned with a premium look and operational feel. So, to sum up. The C350 4matic coupe is fast, comfortable, handles well, rides well, feels premium.....AND..... It was $2K-$3K cheaper than a ""like for like"" 435ix BMW. Icing on the cake....while subjective....I found the Mercedes to look lots better than the BMW, too. While you may get the premium customer treatment at Mercedes, maintenance is extra cost. From what I understand, a fair amount of extra cost. Perhaps this is one of those cars you never take back to the dealership for routine maintenance.

OK, with that much info at hand, I must say it is virtually impossible to use more than a relatively small fraction of the potential of an S4 or SQ5.

But, then again, I might be right. The comment somewhere, ""it's missing a pedal"" is one I personally relate to -- but, well that's two of us. Audi, BMW, et al, certainly WANT our money -- but there is probably very little (if any at all) financial reason to offer 6-speed manual transmissions any more. We're lucky -- I think -- to have the wonderful 7-speed DSG unit that Audi uses in several of its cars, I'm as fine as wine with that transmission. Heck, I've even come 'round to the 8-speed tiptronic when tuned for performance shifting. And, even were I not happy with the 8-speed Audis and BMWs and the 7-speed unit employed by Mercedes, well, I really don't count much anymore. BMW is selling a lot of cars these days -- up over 12%. The super-majority of these sales, I assume, came with automatic transmissions. Good for BMW. Ditto at Audi and MB -- at least I assume so. It has been ""forever"" (2004 or 2005) since I saw, let alone drove a manual transmission at an Audi or BMW dealership. My last stick was an Audi allroad -- 2003 model. My wife's last stick was a 2005 BMW X3 3.0. Since then we've had a 2005 A6, a 2008 X3, an Infiniti 2011 FX35, a 2009 Audi A4, a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD and now a 2014 S4 and SQ5. In this (the examples of the cars we've owned) one way, our buying probably represents more of what most ""real"" people actually buy. Although I would argue that those who buy Audi's S and RS cars and BMW's M's, and Mercedes AMG's no matter how poshed-up, may not be the manufacturers' main, or primary customers. If BMW 3 series cars really have fallen out of favor with many of their previous customers, I would agree (with whoever posted this idea) that for every ""die hard Bimmer-file"" that leaves the fold, several new to the fold customers come on-board.

The Infiniti and the Lexus may have an initial advantage since they are -- ""foundationally"" -- based on RWD chassis. Of course, I wouldn't count out the impact of the PAWS and SH-AWD technology making for perhaps a more interesting showdown.

BMW perhaps makes one of the best wipers in the business.

A guy standing next to him says ""I like automatics- I want to get in the car and not have to do anything."" I told him that if I can't take the car on the track I'm not buying it- and the guy replies, ""I'd never take my car to the track; especially after I spent three hours washing it.""

4302,"June 20, 2014 10:25PM",wayne21,"I plan to wait until the 2015s are out (TLX and Maxima) to seriously car shop, but I was out of town today and stopped by an infiniti and an acura dealership to just check out their cars. Not to test drive them, but was interested in the ease of entry/exit (a very important issue for the wife) and the interior appearance. Infiniti Q50 - nice that the passenger seat elevates! I think wife may be able to get in/out without any difficulty. It was a base model and I thought the interior was fine in spite of the vinyl (I would pay the extra for leather). It's been awhile since I looked at an Altima, but I don't think the Q50s interior was any nicer (maybe not even as nice) than the top of the line Altima. I also didn't understand why there was a spare tire taking up such a large portion of a small trunk in a car that has run-flat tires. But I realize the idea behind the Q50 isn't a ""nice interior"". I had read a number of sites that talked about an odor in the Q50 when left in the heat. I looked at one on the showroom floor (not in the heat) and didn't detect anything. It's a car I could own. Then to the acura dealer just for a look. Looked at the TL with tech package on the floor. I was not impressed. I hope the TLX has a nicer interior. I thought the leather surfaces were nice, but I thought the materials used elsewhere on the interior were pretty cheap - a lot of hard plastic! The passenger seat elevated which was nice to see, but it seemed that in elevating the passenger seat it would be a bit harder to get in and out (harder than the Q50). I think it was the layout of the dash that forced me to move the seat all the way back to get it in that may make it hard for my wife to get in/out. Will wait until seriously shopping and have the wife try it out in the TLX. I am no fan of dealerships adding things to the car and this particular dealership adds about $3,000 to each sticker. I may be off by the individual numbers, but it was $500 for theft marking (if someone steals my car I don't want it back!), $700 to wax the car and spray the interior with scotch guard (I prefer turtle wax ice sealant and my own scotch guard - about $15 for both - and unlike the high school kid working for them that doesn't care about my car, I will do a good job and not miss anything), $750 for wheel locks, mud guards and a rubber mat in the trunk (a mat I wouldn't want in my car) and some other overpriced stuff I wouldn't be interested in and wouldn't pay for. I would pass on the car before paying for any of those things. If I had to choose between the two, it was a no-brainer. It would be the Q50. I don't think I would even be interested in the TL. But once the TLX and maxima are out I'll seriously shop. Just one person's opinion... the guy that's going to pay for it. Not trying to step on anyone's toes or insult anyone. My wife is most interested in something that not everyone has. We bought a Toyota venza in 2010 and that was one of the reasons for purchasing it (as well as incredibly easy entry/exit for her). The people two doors down from us bought the same green venza. At church, we have 4 green venzas and 1 white venza (ours and the white one are the only 6 cylinders) and 3 of the green venzas (1 of which is ours) park side by side at the church (handicap parking)!",hard anyones 750 entryexit people easy think safety working fine dont wife comfort elevates park kid idea persons comfort interested taking could opinion appearance 6 1 styling portion extra behind care cheap paying harder nissan acurax 700 dealer elevated turacurae able 2015s vinyl guy insult seriously stopped fan high brand rubber bought town reasons 15 handicap sealant sites going thought 4 see detect back side runflat dealership stuff nicer doesnt audi0 church base spare toyotas 2010 pay didnt tech surfaces line small large maybe test trying performances ease nice someone guard steals even odor step ice drive dealerships good white 3 anything hope toes toyota without prefer shop inout elsewhere showcomfort want check choose awhile impressed look marking scotch two numercedesers green make 3000 talked top left plastic incredibly may job purchasing understand spite us today sticker passenger parking school overpriced anyone since wax well used try read heat preaudiy adding shopping locks would realize get miss isnt plan things doors nobrainer layout trunk theft way console mud mat wouldnt materials everyone cars wait comfort package pass infiniti safety numercedeser 500 adds bit important ill issue guards looked something lot acura move individual one spray forced also car unlike particular thcadillac floor elevating seemed difficulty audi0s

I had added the rear parking sensors and the ""factory"" splash guards to the car and I, to this day, call my TL, my ""Honda S4"" or my ""Acura S4"" -- the car must've come with 3-bent wheels, which may be the reason I thought the brake rotors were warped and had them turned three times (all under warranty). Once the wheels were replaced (with a 50% credit from Acura), the car was smooth and the brakes didn't chatter or feel warped in any way. I got the idea to call the TL my ""Acura S4"" not from an original thought, but from an Automobile test report where the S4 and the TL were compared even though the report observed most folks would probably NOT cross shop the two cars (they were some $11,000 apart, too -- the Audi was more expensive, of course). I got tired of the Acura feeling about 90% of what I had hoped it would be -- which is actually a compliment considering I was comparing it to a car that was about 25% more money. In any case, my Audi dealer (who is also an Acura dealer, go figure) made me a deal I couldn't refuse once he found out I had ordered a new Lexus IS350AWD F-Sport. Bought out the Acura lease (less than a year to go as I recall) and gave me a discount of 6% off the sticker of a new S4 configured exactly as I wanted it. At the same time, my wife's Infiniti (2011 FX) was also coming off a 39 month lease and, yes, you guessed it, the Audi dealer (also an Acura dealer) is also an Infiniti dealer and once they got wind of my wife's tap dancing with a new BMW X3, made her an offer on a new Audi SQ5, that she couldn't refuse. During our shopping adventure, we test drove the daylights out of all the usual (and some unusual) suspects. I oh so wanted the Q50S/AWD to be the ""it"" car for the 2014 MY. It was good, maybe almost very good -- but for the money that I had to pay for the 2014 S4 I ended up with, I couldn't do it.

With respect to reliability, however, I would have to say my European cars have not lacked reliability, but the longest I ever kept one was 66,000 miles (a 2005 Audi A6), so I am probably not the poster boy to tout European reliability. My negative reliability experiences all have had to do with American cars -- and mostly Chrysler cars, at that. The thing is, as ""unreliable"" as the American cars proved to be, well, it was pretty close to impossible to KILL one of them -- so I guess I would say I've had unreliable, yet durable cars -- and I thought, at one point, ""why can't I have both?"" Sit down: Then I bought a brand new AMC ""American Eagle"" -- my first AWD car (pre Audi, if you can believe it -- but I am, after all 62 years old). Holy cow, talk about a rolling pile of junk -- if it wasn't welded on, it fell off. The brakes were ""same day"" affairs -- but the thing had a plaid cloth interior and a really cool steering wheel (leather wrapped).

I don't know if you know this, but Audis come with a pretty neat technology called ""Audi Connect."" It is provided at no charge for 6 months then it is simply shut off if you don't elect to subscribe to it (at $30 per month or the equivalent of $15 per month for a $450 lump sum payment). Audi connect through 2014 MY's utilizes T-Mobile as a carrier to provide Internet connectivity and the ability to turn your car into a WiFi hotspot. Using Audi connect and apparently some neat software from Google, many desirable features are offered that are probably worth up to $15 per month on a month-to-month payment plan. The thing is the carrier is T-Mobile. I can't begin to tell you how poor T-Mobile is -- and when it is at full-strength, it is 3G, very slow and often drops down to 2G, and, well, has very poor signal coverage here in our River City. Sitting right on the showroom floor, however, is a new Premium+ A3 with 4G LTE AT&T Audi connect. It fires right up, goes about 3 or 4 times faster and is quicker to start-up to boot. So Audi calls me and wants me to re-up my Audi connect plan -- I do offer $15 per month paid monthly, not $450 in one lump -- IF I can swap out the simm card or the radio itself, for a new carrier -- AT&T would be fine, so would Verizon. Now I do understand that you may be loving T-Mobile if you're in certain areas of the US. But what may be good in Baltimore sucks in Cincinnati from a phone coverage, speed and drop-out perspective. I've had Sprint, Verizon and AT&T (currently with AT&T since I got off my BlackBerry -- which was RIMM wasn't it?) The only service I've ever had any issues with is, you guessed it T-Mobile. You'd think there is a little radio device behind the face of the dashboard that is, after all, a cell-phone. Just like when I got rid of the BlackBerry and went with the iPhone (and changed service providers), there ought to be a way to swap out the tech -- not buy a whole new car for pity's sake. My friend has a private plane -- the thing must be a million years old, but ""the avionics"" are as current as can be just as the engine and the whole plane are ""overhauled"" annually to keep them ""jus like new"". It seems to me that the electronic features of these cars hits the showroom floor one generation behind (sometimes more); wouldn't you win friends (and customers) and influence people if you could market your cars as having the ability to be kept current (at least insofar as some ""electronic"" systems are concerned?) I probably answered my own question, the reason these systems are not ""allowed"" to be updated with new tech has to do with marketing and money not feature and function.

My wife doesn't want another Toyota (we have a 6 cyl venza) or Honda (had an accord). I had a 2000 accord and it had tons of wind noise. In 2005, I looked at an accord (knowing about wind noise) and the wind noise was very obvious to me on each one we test drove so we bought a ford. In 2010, I test drove a couple accords and could hear wind noise on the test drives (ez to do when you actively listen for it) so we bought a Toyota. I have test driven and ridden in a few new accords (close friend has a 2014) and can hear the wind noise (my friend hears nothing). Wife doesn't want another ""car that everyone else has"" so I thought we'd step up. I know a number of people with acuras and when I ask them about wind noise they all say yes it is noticeable, but tolerable. I'm not interested in hearing wind noise. I'd think Honda could figure out how to build cars without wind noise. Cars I'm considering - Acura TLX (agree on the first year model thing, but thought it to be a worth a look - just the wind noise issue associated with acuras/hondas), Infinit Q50 (don't care for the option packages I have to buy to get what I want), and the pending 2015 maxima (a significant update that I don't know much about, but my wife likes the looks of the car). I might even consider a Hyundai genesis sedan. The venza runs great and we're not in a hurry, but if the right ""upscale"" car comes along I'd buy it. (Car buying is a ""two vote"" for us - with no pressure to sway a vote so I think I'll wait to at least look at a maxima before buying, but I'm not sure when they're coming out - I think Sept.",sway 2015 along people id listen think dont ford tolerable wife sights ridden im hurry build consider ask say actively interested could 6 knowing worth care great nissan acurax acurashonda hears bought brand acuras upscale driven else update performance pressure sept thought infinit yes considering noticeable know much runs doesnt least audi0 another sedan 2010 obvious couple packages test close googling hear sweendogy even step buying new right friend toyota thank wed without want might look two coming significant theyre 2000 honda drives wind us first hyundai associated agree year 2005 ez figure get tons drove seen everyone cars wait buy likes numercedeser 2014 sure option ill issue looked hearing nothing acura vote one looks thing pending car comes noise

4356,"June 15, 2014  3:28PM",roblaw," The Genesis is a very quiet car and the 2015 Genesis is probably quieter still. But you have to know what you want. The TLX is likely to be sportier than a Genesis. The new Genesis is a full on luxury car with a premium interior and wonderful seats. It handles well but I will bet the TLX will be tidier, if for no other reason than it is will smaller and Honda has a good rep for tidy handling cars. The Genesis It is going to weigh probably 400+ lbs. more than a TLX is you compare the 3.5 TLX to a 3.8 Genesis. It is probably almost a foot longer. I will bet the TLX will handle better, be faster, be pretty quiet and get much better fuel economy (and front wheel drive will be better in bad weather as compared to the RWD Genesis unless you purchase the AWD model which will cost more and have even worse mileage). It really depends on what you want and what you are willing to spend. Also, as great a car as the new Genesis is, its resale will probably be lower than the TLX because of the perception of Hyundais and the price (probably comparable to the TLX when comparably equipped). This will affect the overall cost of the vehicle whether you buy and hold or lease and dump. So drive a lot of cars and try to ignore preconceived notions, as hard as that is. I think Acura/Honda is coming back from its worst years and probably still makes excellent cars. Hyundai also makes fine cars today (remember the 1986 Excel?).

4360,"June  6, 2014 12:32PM",dino001," In other, words people buy what they want. They don't care if other people don't think that ""it"" is worth the price. Conversely, other people cannot even comprehend why somebody would buy something like filltheblank because there is another filltheblank just as good (in their eyes, anyway) and cheaper. And it's all good. There is another type of discussion we have here constantly - does filltheblank belong to ELLPS? Honestly, I don't really understand why people get so worked up if it does, or does not. Many people would cross shop cars that are not the same ""category"", so what... The line will always be blurred and they move. Yesterday's luxury is today's standard. Yesterday's benchmark of sportiness (like manual transmission) is becoming so rare that it's impossible to use as an actual measuring stick. Prices go up incessantly, so yesterday's 30K car is today's 40K. And so on. If somebody cross shops Ford Focus ST or Subaru WRX/STI with BMW 328i and somebody else cross-shops Lexus ES (not even IS) with same BMW, who am I to say they are ""wrong"" about looking at them? They'll choose what they like at the end, it may not be ELLPS, but who cares. I say something much more revolutionary - ELLPS is dead, there is no ELLPS. There is bunch of former ELLPS, but they got so diverse that it's too wide. Some lost ""Entry Level"" pricing (long time ago, I might say), others lost performance, others went beyond ""Entry Level"" luxury.

There is also a small breed of AWD (some are FWD) bandits that are ""too small"" or don't have enough ""stuff"", but 30 years ago ""real"" ELLPS were just their size, had lesser 0-60, slalom time, crank windows, cloth seats and nobody was ranting they were no ELLPS.

His questions were odd, but focused. He asked what kind of car I had, when I told him none at moment, asked why, and if I'm in the market for a car. After about 20 minutes I asked him what he did. Come to find out he works for Intellishop, then we started talking about mystery shoppers and such. He asked if I would be interested in being a mystery shopper, but declined, but knew someone who would, Rick. We talk about him and my seatmate was happy. So for the past year Rick been a mystery shopper for Intellishop, this is where the testing of cars come from. It's been interesting so far the Kia K900 and E350 have been standouts, maybe not in the way you think. K900 is a home run, but the biggest issue is getting people who can afford a $66K car to come into the dealer or think about Kia. E350, the saleman was the worst but the car he showed us was absolutely stunning, the color combo worked on the car. That is the only positive thing Rick said about the whole MB experience. We weren't even offered a test drive, and haven't driven a E class in several years I was looking forward to it. In regards to cross shopping, the Kia dealer ask this when we looked at the Cadzena and K900, no other dealer ask this question. The interesting thing about Intellishop is you have a ""script"" already going into the dealership, and a certain car to look at. At the MB dealer, we had to look at the E350 ""gas"" so the new E350 Bluetec was out of the question, but really want to test drive this car... This whole debate on what is and isn't a ELLPS is really a subjective thing, just like in the medical word, pain is a subjective.

For e.g., when a consumer buys an Apple product, they expect a certain level of quality and attention to detail, which you will not find in other company products. Take for e.g. Samsung, their main competitor in the cell phone area - even though a Samsung phone may have more features and may seem like a better value for money to lot of people, it just cannot compete with Apple in terms of quality and attention to detail. Samsung uses cheap plastic to make their phones. Apple will never do that. The engineers at Apple spend so much time on each small tine little thing, that when you hold their finished product, you can just feel how good it is. Same holds true for cars, Lexus represents a certain brand, so does Audi and BMW. What brand does Hundai or Kia represent? Even though they may have more features than BMW or Lexus, they just feel cheap, because at their core they are a value brand.

4384,"June  9, 2014  7:32PM",markcincinnati,"The ELLPS Category is More Alive Now Than at Any Other Time in History (Part 1) I’m going to take exception to the suggestion that “ELLPS” as a category is “dead” – indeed, I think it is a very much alive and healthy category/segment; it is almost certainly growing and definitely aspirational category. Both consumers and manufacturers aspire – and often ardently aspire – in their own way to this category in fact. “ELLPS's are like porn, I can’t define them, but I know them when I see them. . .” We can’t go on unless some stipulations are made, and these stipulations are possibly made up of nearly equal parts of fact and opinion (I would agree if you said opinion is weighed more heavily should you be so inclined to make that argument). ELLPS autos are difficult to define – perhaps the [unintentionally ironic, I’m sure] quote above, a derivative of Justice Potter Stewart’s famous remark, “I know it [obscenity] when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that,"" captures the essence of the problem of figuring out what is and what is not an ELLPS. I think I’ll just go with something like: An ELLPS is an automobile with more basic or “included” content or other “stuff”, one that is generally thought to be of higher quality (another “I know it when I see it” attribute, to be sure) with more “available” comfort/convenience/performance features and amenities, higher style/design attributes (ditto) and noticeably more precise fit and finish (tighter tolerances) than other vehicles that the ELLPS candidate can be measured up against. The dealership experience also bears noting too, as it is, or should be, a cut above, too. The ELLPS is kind of an anomaly (or at least it was), since its creators want us to know it offers both luxury and performance, traits that used to be almost mutually exclusive. Perhaps an ELLPS candidate or incumbent is (or should be) like the tire type we call “Grand Touring”. But, then, even that metaphor falls short these days, as it certainly appears that one of the prices (pun intended) for entry into the 2014 ELLPS class is “higher performance numbers” than even a few short years ago in the 21st century. Maybe, today (for American consumers), the more correct tire metaphor for an ELLPS is “Ultra High-performance All-season”. Of course, we need be mindful of the “S” in ELLPS, which, of course stands for sedan (and I’ll put a stake in the ground that this means 4-doors, despite whatever model names some manufacturer comes up with – thinking of the name “4-door coupé” for instance). Perhaps some attempt to say what is not an ELLPS would be helpful (as would a level setting question or two): A Bentley (any Bentley) is not an ELLPS (I would argue it is not an LPS either), nor is any Porsche (even a Panamera falls outside of even the most liberal definitions of both ELLPS and LPS, if you axe me) or a Hyundai. But does this exclude the somewhat stand-alone models named Genesis and Equus? I think both the Genesis and Equus fall short on their “P” quotients, making them ineligible for either ELLPS or LPS inclusion, but maybe that’s just me and possibly this is a temporary situation – see the latest Car & Driver review of the Genesis sedan now with “suspension tuning by Lotus”). Buicks don’t count either, right? But wait, what about the Regal GS with AWD and a few option boxes checked off – such as most all of the electronic safety nannies so popular with the presumptively bona fide ELLPS members from Germany, Japan (and Sweden)?

4386,"June  9, 2014  7:34PM",markcincinnati,"The ELLPS Category is More Alive Now Than at Any Other Time in History (Part 2) Can any sedan, regardless of pedigree, be inducted (or indicted) into the ELLPS hall of fame if it cannot be had with either RWD or AWD (FWD only cars need not apply); likewise can any sedan that is primarily, obviously and overwhelmingly badge engineered apply for ELLPS or LPS club membership (thinking of the current Lincoln MKZ which screams badge engineered Ford Fusion here)? Hopefully, too, we can stipulate that to be in the ELLPS, even with all of the MSRP bracket-creep we’ve seen these past few years, that there is a “size component” we should probably consider. For example, even though today’s BMW 3 is pretty darn close in size to yesterday’s 5, we will accept a 3 series (no matter how pricey) as a member of the ELLPS clan in good standing, but we won’t admit any 5 series (even if it is configured to be less expensive – with a 4-cylinder turbo, and option stripped – than a 3 series) because the 5 series is simply too big (at least at this instant in history; and, let’s agree this could change as the 2’s, 3’s and 5’s morph into god knows what next). And for pity’s sake are we going to point to something like the new A3 – which is exactly the same size as an earlier gen A4 – and say, “Nope, you’re not ELLPS, you’re a Premium car.” Personally, I’d exclude the A3 from the club, perhaps calling it an Entry-level ELLPS instead. But, that would be just plain silly. Yet, for discussion purposes, I’m not sure I want to be engaging in conversations with those who aren’t interested in, ahem, “The right kind, or our kind” [of car] – you know, allowing them in here just might make the conversations even messier and perhaps occasionally, er, ""from time-to-time"", even more pugnacious and xenophobic than they are already (if that’s even possible). So we’re left with [my] belief [and maybe yours too] that the American automobile consumer is faced with a segmented market (one that is growing more so all the time). Perhaps there are divergent opinions on this that follows: Virtually every car manufacturer on the planet wants to have cars that are in the ELLPS and LPS class – and granted ELLPS can mean different things for folks in Beijing and Buffalo. The reason for this LPS-Lust is simple: Premium compacts (like the new A3), ELLPS’s (like the Lexus IS 350 F-Sport) and LPS’s like the Mercedes E-class, etc. are where the profit margins soar. No wonder Hyundai (and KIA) are, with each successive generation, pushing hard, harder, hardest to be members of the Acura (for now), Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes and possibly Volvo Club. Why? So they can raise prices, natch. Remember the Lexus playbook (bring in a car -- and give it a ""number"", not a name: LS400 -- that apparently has 100% of the Mercedes content down-pat and sell it at 75-80% of the price of the Merc)? The only thing that might be the “yes but” for the Korean’s is that they’re trying to become ELLPS and LPS club members without separate, purpose-built dealerships – this admittedly cost and time saving approach may ultimately not sit well with the ELLPS and LPS cognoscente or even the general car consuming hoi polloi; yet, the only person I know who has an Equus says the dealership experience has been superlative. For now, we need not – here – concern ourselves with discussions or comparisons to the really high-end cars (like the Bentley mentioned above or other super-luxury brands from foreign lands). At this point in time, we’ve got some really interesting cars to discuss and an upcoming pipeline that is exemplified by Car & Driver’s recent article “25 Cars Worth Waiting For”. The ELLPS category is more alive now than at any other time in history. At least that’s the way I see it.

And I guess it is clear you require brand snobbery as part of the criteria, as opposed to being based on purely function.",part disagree require mark snobbery performance opposed blanket function clear purely based guess exclusion brand criteria
4388,"June  9, 2014  8:37PM",markcincinnati,"I think disagreement regarding FWD is a good thing. I have had many -- or at least ""several"" FWD cars from US and German mfgrs over the years and I found them worthy of many things, perhaps even inclusion into the ELLPS and LPS rank and file. Funny, sort of, it used to be that 4-cylinder motivated cars need not apply. Well, my my my how things have changed. I'd be (I've been) proud and pleased to have a 4-cylinder BMW or Audi and probably I'd be fine with an ATS with a 4-cylinder motivator too. Right now, today, at this instant, however, I believe FWD vehicles need not apply -- regardless of how you and I may feel and think about the subject. I think the bias, right now, against FWD is so strong it may be ""stronger than dirt""! Evidence the Genesis ""brand"" -- Genesis eschewed anything but RWD for the first generation, now with the new ones, they're offering up both RWD and AWD in the 6-cylinder version and promised AWD in the 8 ""soon"". FWD, currently and based on much that I read here and by the pros is like an embarrassing tattoo you got one night when you were ""not quite right"" for some reason. You're working on getting rid of it ASAP, but these things take time. On the other hand, who knows, the benefits (and there are many) of FWD may win out after all. Just remember that FWD was initially put in cars to make them cheaper (to make and buy). There is, for some, a stigma associated with ""FWD"" cars that aspire to be in the Premium, ELLPS, LPS, High-end luxury or Super luxury class. Same holds true for sports cars, super cars and exotics -- they are (or must be to not be posers) RWD or AWD. Mercedes did bring out the CLA as FWD, to be sure -- and there is some risk there (but it can be had with AWD); the A3 is also FWD (like most Audi models) and offers up AWD. At this point ALL incoming inventory for the A3's (here in Cincinnati) will be quattros. That may change. The ATS and CTS were rendered from the get-go as RWD (with AWD available) because that is what is (NOW, today) expected. Luxury may or may not = ""Snobbery"". We're talking, here, on this forum, about some variation of a type that contains the words: Luxury, Performance, Sedan -- entry level or not. Luxury is beyond (above? beside? below? -- pick one) being based on ""pure function"", I think is safe to say. Luxury means to most of us, I assume, ""stuff"", features, amenities, capabilities, levels of refinement beyond what is ""basic"", beyond what is strictly necessary. If you think this equates to brand snobbery, even if I conceded (personally) your point, even if I 100% agreed with you, this is the place where ""we"" are going to discuss, debate, and perhaps even politely argue about luxury cars (that happen to also be capable of a decent amount of ""high"" performance). So yes, brand snobbery is ""a"" criteria for this discussion, just not necessarily ""my"" criteria to be a member of ""the club"". However, I can somewhat sense saying ""If the shoe fits"" isn't an inappropriate thought. I saw a very long and impressive video about the Chrysler 300C when it first came out -- and the Chrysler engineers involved in rendering this fine car kept comparing it to an Audi A8. I love the 300C, especially the ones with the refreshed interiors and AWD, but Senator, ""I've known A8's and you ain't no Audi A8."" The point is, we -- here -- are but PART of the market -- and we may disagree with the overall market's standards and definitions (and they keep changing all of the time) -- but we need to recognize, I think, the prevailing trends, ideas and standard-bearers.

Going on and on about how a 5, 10, 15 year old or older car and proclaiming it is better than the current crop must've been said/written sarcastically or perhaps ironically. Not that everything new is better, but, well as a general rule things (like cars) have tended to be better along with the passage of time. Stick shifts are great, ""no one"" buys them anymore because: see #2. Oh, somewhere I read that even in cars -- like the ELLPS's -- that actually do offer stick shifts, the take-up by actual paying customers continues to shrink and it is something less than 3% or perhaps 2%. Now that I have, in my garage, a 7-speed dual-clutch and an 8-speed tiptronic, I know the reason. If the best of breed 8-speed doesn't ""shift your opinion"" well today's 7-speed dual-clutch certainly will be virtually irresistible. Some folks here will correctly note that they can option load-up a non-ellps car, note that it meets or beats the ""fill-in-the-blank"" ellps in content, performance and the big one, price and apparently end with an implied ""so how 'bout them apples"" or ""so there!"" Continuing: In my experience ""people need those stinkin' badges!"" To make a, or perhaps ""the"" point: My MontBlanc pen uses a 3 or 4-dollar refill, the same one used in some other really ""way less expensive"" (I'll say) pens. In the same spirit, my Tag watch doesn't tell time any better than my $750 Swiss Army Watch I got at Macy's. That's not the point -- well, OK, it may be ONE point, but it's the overall ""certain something"" that makes luxury goods, well, hmm, ""worth more."" Once I get over ""needing"" a white and blue roundel or four interlocking rings, etc, well, I'll get a KIA of some sort.

4408,"June  5, 2014  1:35AM",markcincinnati,"I do like, very much, my Victorinox Swiss Army watch -- I think it, in some ways, looks nicer than the Tag. But, the thing is, the Victorinox is not a ""luxury"" watch. A new Malibu LTZ (a very attractive looking car), is also not an Infiniti, Lexus, BMW, Audi, Mercedes -- it even doesn't fit in the same class as the Volvo S60. We're here -- well some of us are -- in ELLPS land perhaps because we ""choose"" not to buy/lease an LPS automobile. Perhaps some of us -- as Alfred Sloan imagined -- would start with a Chevy and aspire to a Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and ultimately a Cadillac. I suspect Sloan is the father of the term ""aspirational"" as it applied to cars. We're here, I'll bet, because we either aspire to an ELLPS, have an ELLPS and aspire to an LPS or are just car-nuts who know the good stuff comes from Audi, BMW, Infiniti, etc. I was wondering today when the last time I saw a Phaeton was -- years ago is all I could come up with. Saw several A8's today, however. I test drove a Phaeton (way back when) which was seriously discounted and sub-vented (and as a reminder I owned an A8) thinking I could get a ""new A8"" for a fraction of the cost by going with the Phaeton. The Phaeton was, closed eyes, an A8. Same sweeeet 4.2L V8, quattro (well, you know) etc. I just couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger -- probably the biggest bargain I'll ever see. Damn HUGE-[non-permissible content removed] ""VW"" emblem on the thing. Instead of the bargain it probably was, I knew I would be thinking, ""I paid THIS MUCH for a VW?!? What was I thinking?"" You know I still think if you can't or won't go with an S4, the next best thing is the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance (and I assume the TLX is even better). Even my non-car loving friends called my TL ""a Honda."" Slamming the tinny doors was just enough of a confirmation of that notion to remind me that the Acura brand had slipped from Premium status. My wife collects pens -- I have perhaps four or five (that were gifts from her) -- I probably would not go out and buy a new 4-figure MontBlanc, but I do notice when I see Brian Williams use one on the air. My MontBlancs (3 of them) are all the pens I need (one of them broke and I had to send it to Germany to get it fixed -- seems as good as new). My wife must get 6 new pens per year. I sort of get it. Until her current car (the SQ5 Prestige), she liked cars, but wasn't really ""passionate"" about them. Get this, for about 15 minutes she actually considered a Subaru -- which was pretty nice, but kind of trucky and not at all luxurious or even terribly sporty. I knew she would love the price and by the time she needed her second tank of gas would be ""praying for the end of time"" (Meat Loaf). Now, however, she is ""into cars"" and is unlikely to aspire to anything other than an Audi or a BMW -- I can't see reverse aspiration being a viable option (for her or for most people, in fact). Anyway, this collection of ELLPS cars is perhaps the most exciting and ""strokable"" lot in all of cardom. It is here that we see innovation (often before the LPS offerings, even from the same brand), performance and often a huge leap up from even the top of the next lower line.

4414,"June  5, 2014  6:37PM",markcincinnati,"Sween, Small correction, I used the term ""strokable"" in my post, I'm not sure how it got translated to ""stokable"" -- I meant, by strokable, cars that are as described in the next post by 'm6user' who continued and gave an additional example of the point. Also it was a rip-off of a Wayne's World throwaway line by Mike Meyers. Also, yes, these are entry-level LPS cars and they can be less expensive than the next step up. However, many if not all of these ellps cars can be easily optioned to numbers beginning with a 5 or a 6. So while it is true that ellps customers -- and want to be customers -- may be somewhat budget minded (since they're not shopping further up the MSRP scale, apparently) folks that shop and buy these vehicles are looking for ""better"" and/or ""more"" and/or a pretty hefty step up in luxury features and perceived quality of materials. OK, the forum is about cars, not other luxury goods -- perhaps the analogies and some poorly written or expressed sarcasm or irony are misplaced. In response to the shopper who configures a Ford Taurus SHO and then remarks the ""fill in the blank"" ellps or lps isn't worth the extra $X-thousands, I had hoped the point would be punctuated by examples in other areas, e.g., outdoor grills, pens and watches. Some folks only buy Rolex's (not me, FWIW) and some see not one bit of extra value in a Rolex when they can have a far less expensive timepiece, etc, etc. Some folks wouldn't pay $1,000 more for an upgraded audio system in their new Mercedes C -- but might spring for the MontBlanc. If someone wants to ""prove"" than a Subaru WRX is the equivalent of or superior to a BMW 335 X-drive, by configuring both ""similarly"" and then citing some performance stats, well have at it. The WRX, for all I know, may actually out-accelerate the Bimmer and so on -- but that doesn't make the Subie an ellps or lps by any stretch. Anyway, if the grills, pens and watches analogies don't track, I'll endeavor to minimize such transgressions. I do not, however know what ""enuf of the better then now stuff"" means. These cars, I think we all mostly agree, are better ""now"" than ""then."" I guess several of the reviews of the Q50 have suggested that it did not improve upon the G37 -- which may be what you were referring to.

4418,"June  6, 2014 12:17AM",markcincinnati,"I would suggest, perhaps even argue, the dollar becomes progressively less of a major factor when we move into any incarnation of the Premium or Luxury class (especially where cars are concerned). Folks -- generally speaking -- don't shop for ellps or lps cars with much consideration for budget (however, even when buying an ellps, I assume we all stipulate $X dollars for the purchase -- of our new 3 series or new IS 350, etc). I would hope we all want to get the most we can for our dollar, and I assume we do. If, however, you want to spend less, it is quite possible to move down a rung and get, for instance, a Chrysler 300 -- and there is NOTHING wrong with that. The reason the Escalade (for example) exists is because there are folks who are very happy to pay for the Caddy over the lesser GM offerings that lack the Wreath and Crest. Of course there are substantive differences (between the Cadillac and the GMC for instance), but if you read the profits story you know the margins ARE much higher the more you climb the lux/premium/ellps/lps ladder. Perhaps the luxury goods represent a lesser ""value"" since they have higher profit margins -- but I'll wager if fill in the blank produces yet another vehicle with breathtakingly expensive MSRP's there will probably be no shortage of takers. Who would have thought an X6 would have a market -- well, not me. And, much as I love Audis, I test drove -- back to back -- an A6 and an A7 and until I opened the glove box and found the stack of bills, I kept hunting for the $10,000 premium the A7 commanded. They can't keep the A7's in stock. If you had any concern about price for content, there would be far fewer A7 sales ""if you axe me!"" I have a few ""expensive"" pens (gifts from my wife, to repeat), I ""appreciate"" them, but would not buy them for myself. Like laurasdada, I see the ""value"" of the Omega or the IWC or the Tag, I also appreciate the Invicta and the Swiss Army -- in sum this particular forum is less about ""budget"" or ""value"" or ""MSRP"" than it is about folks who ""aspire"" to ""the next step up the ladder.""

Luxury cars are not strictly delineated by the car but by the dealer, warranty, service etc that also comes with the purchase of luxury nameplate. The reason why many on here were opposed to the TSX being included here was that it didn't seem to have the performance side nailed down. However, it did have the luxury side nailed down pretty well as most of the things recently mentioned came standard on it. I think when you buy(and pay extra for) a luxury car from a luxury nameplate there should be somewhat of a basic standard which one can expect without having to option the vehicle up to the hilt just to reach the standard that most other luxury brands start off with.

I'm not knocking the 320i. I had one as a loaner once. For my daily driving needs it would suit me just fine. Around town I found it comfortable and docile. It rode smooth on the highway. I'm quite sure the current body style chassis is stronger and the 320i handles better than my 2011 328xi. I did find myself having to plan a little bit for passing maneuvers. I don't like the MASSIVE headrests or the giant screen stuck on top of the dashboard. I even think the 320i is a much better looking vehicle than the X1.

I know that BMWs even in their ""base"" form are better driving cars than their competitors. Our 1st BMW was my wife's 2007 X3 that had 3 options: Heated Seats, Rear Privacy Glass, & Metallic Paint.

4459,"May 30, 2014  8:56PM",tlong,"Honestly sometimes the snobbery stereotypes of BMW drivers are apparent even in this forum. Really, your car doesn't measure testosterone levels. I'm not particularly a huge fan of BMW, but I can admire their vehicles and what they've done in the marketplace. To me, being ""sporty"" is NOT about horsepower or torque. Sure, that's nice, but if that were what was important I'd buy a Vette or a Camaro. Straight-line acceleration is not what makes an ELLPS appealing to me. I admire and appreciate, shall we say, ""precision"". I like precise, tight steering. I like a reasonably comfortable, yet firm and precise ride. I like going around corners, not at 0.8g, but in a way that the steering feel is precise, I know exactly where the car is going to go, and I can feel the feedback through the steering wheel. I don't even particularly care to autocross my vehicles or pull high g's in corners. So I also like a ""nice"" interior. I can get fairly lower-horsepower, ""precise"" vehicles at reasonable cost (the Mazda 3 comes to mind). But those vehicles usually don't have the ""nicer"" interiors that I like. It was all of these thoughts and characteristics that caused me to buy an A4 in the late '90's. And now I drive an '05 TL, and you know what - although the interior is ""nice"" and the horsepower is quite good, the driving dynamics are still a bit too floaty/boaty and lacking. So I DON'T begrudge somebody liking a 320i. It's not all about testosterone, or horsepower, at least to some of us. And it's not about snobbery, either. We all have different needs and tastes.

I am quoting from an article that I read online (http://www.bimmer-mag.com/issues/120/articles/practical-considerations?page=4#.U4odyagWeG0): Beyond that entry-level buyer, here’s who should also consider the 320i: urban commuters seeking BMW handling, luxury, connectivity and panache, and those upon whom the harsh realization has dawned that they don’t need a rocket car to satisfy their daily driving needs. From stoplight-to-stoplight, it would be rather nice to use less gas, and it’s equally nice to spend less money. The 36-month lease payment is $50 less for the 320i than that for the 328i, and even though the latter is much quicker and potentially faster, you won’t miss that sitting in traffic. The two cars are virtually indistinguishable at light throttle under 40 mph. Why pay more? That's me going from a BMW 335d to 320i. I save $200 per month on my lease and I am actually having more fun with the 320i. Maybe because its lighter, not sure, but it feels just more lively and the handling is so much more precise. I could have gone with Focus ST or G37 and saved some more money (for some reason the GTI and A3 lease much higher due to really bad residuals), but decided to stay with BMW, since having had it before, I knew exactly what I was getting - a RWD sedan that handles great and is lot of fun to drive in around the city.",dawned bmwi driving feels comfort handles think bad month horseperformance lively ford stay decided virtually plekto‌ quoting consider rather could 36month premium ’ laaudier equally 50 quicker great exacacuray around 40 200 going due money really needs reason geaudiing much performance preference satisfy performance need sedan haudipwwwbimmermagcomissues120articlespracticalconsiderationspage4u4odyagweg0 pay light efficiency performance upon maybe saved rocket audi lower online commuters nice even throtacurae drive bmw higher terms save st realization payment lease daily seeking traffic entrylevel less two indistinguishable knew connectivity faster stoplighconsolestoplight though siaudiing beyond harsh personal since gone read would performance per get miss bmwd buyer potentially fun spend residuals urban article actually cars infiniti sure lighter use lot panache like also precise car city comes thcadillac volkswagen

4492,"May 28, 2014  8:31PM",markcincinnati,"Been so busy for weeks! Promised myself I would at least make a post when the '14 S4 reached 10,000 miles. Well, I'm about 400 miles away from 11,000 and I need to report to the collective that once again Audi has managed to build an engine that starts out strong, reboots itself somehow around 5,000 miles into a stronger (and more economical) version of itself, then settles in for another 5,000 miles before it again reboots itself into a noticeably more potent version. My wife's SQ5 also has passed 10,000 miles and I am now fully able to discern the differences between her 8-speed tiptronic transmission and my 7-speed s-tronic. In a nutshell: the 8-speed seems, to me at least, to offer the most balanced (of the attributes comfort and sport) presentation of goodness in ""D"" -- the thing is virtually always in its sweet spot in terms of torque on tap, although the downshift rev-matching seems to be, hmm, ""muted"" or somehow pushed out of the foreground. Conversely, the S4 in ""D"" seems hell-bent to hide the performance of the supercharged engine behind a penchant to always shift up a second or a second and half too soon. Also, the s-tronic, in ""D"" really doesn't seem to want you to notice when it downshifts as you are slowing down. In ""S"" mode, the S4 can bear its teeth providing gobs of torque, a willingness to pull in second gear as if it were on a mission to pull a 100 year old tree stump out of hard dirt. Also, in ""S"" mode the S4 under even somewhat mild acceleration makes that delightful ""burp or fart"" sound upon up-shift, time after time. The s-tronic is a miracle of modern medicine in fact. When I got into the SQ5 the other day, I felt the transmission attempt to provide velvety shifts (which it did virtually all of the time, except when I pressed it hard, not to). The slight differences in feel between the two transmissions are that the s-tronic can also provide velvety shifts, but they are just ""this much"" smoother somehow -- shifts that under light or moderate acceleration are more heard than felt. The differences are subtle when you're pressing lightly on the right pedal, but even the masterful Audi transmission programmers cannot completely make the tiptronic mimic the s-tronic's slick moves. The sport seats in both Audi ""S"" models continue to impress with no break-in or break-down of any kind perceptible -- and, the interiors still look fresh despite the recent time I spent sitting behind the wheel of a Premium+ A3 (didn't get to drive it, however.) The technology too is impressive, even though the choice of T-mobile as the in-car WiFi carrier (3G with very poor signal quality about 1/3rd of the time and 2G with even worse quality the rest of the time) impresses like a turd in a swimming pool. I have repeatedly asked Audi for an upgrade to another carrier (AT&T, Verizon, cup and a string), I have to assume there is something that (for some fee) could be done to unlock the technology to get off of what has to be the worst cellular carrier ever (at least in SW Ohio). Of course when you get behind the wheel of a new A3 you notice NO T-MOBILE this time around. You can bet by 2016 all Audis will be divorced from T-Mobile. I'd keep my subscription if they'd price it in synch with its usefulness, perhaps $7.50 per month (in SW Ohio anyway). Instead they want $30 per month on a month-to-month basis. That fellow ELLPS lovers is the only flaw in other-wise delightful pair of ""S"" Audi cars.

The presumably typically optioned Macan S at the Porsche dealership (which owns the Audi dealership too) was about $64K. My wife's Prestige SQ5 was $63.5K or something close to that. An argument could be made that the Prestige SQ5 with several upgrades is still less ($5K) than a comparably equipped Macan S. I would think, however, if you're looking at the two at sub $65K, the Macan may present itself as, well, a Porsche! And, even if the Audi is the ""deal"" it is still NOT A PORSCHE. I would want to drive both and I would want to be fair with the option set up. I am an Audi fan, to be sure, but the Macan could cannibalize the SQ5 -- not the mainline Q5's, the SQ5.

4500,"May 29, 2014  8:43PM",markcincinnati,"A part of the reason folks buy the LPS and ELLPS cars is ""the logo."" Yep, you can almost always find something that seems to equal and often better the ""LPS"" and/or ""ELLPS"" -- call it whatever you want (including brainwashing), but folks frequently look at a fairly large swath of the market and then end up with a ""fill in the blank"" because it is a ""fill in the blank."" I would suspect, as a somewhat related example, that the Macan S might cannibalize the SQ5's sales (especially if there are Macans on the lot for under $60K), because the Macan is a Porsche. My friend, thinking he had an a-ha moment bought a Passat CC thinking he got so much more than he would have gotten (in this case) in an A4. Now, the truth of the matter is that he may be accurate in his Consumer Reports Clinical assessment of the two vehicles. Perhaps ""hate"" is too strong of a word, but -- he hated the CC -- because it WASN'T an Audi. Same story goes for someone who did the same kind of thing with a Nissan instead of an Infiniti, they couldn't wait to early terminate the lease. Several additional data points are certainly possible for me to share with y'all -- but you probably have your own data points and stories to tell about someone who ""saw the light"" and finally got the Infiniti instead of the BMW and then, almost immediately, was pining for a BMW (which would have been seriously de-contented when compared to the Infiniti -- which cost less money too.) I sat in (didn't drive) a maxed out Avalon and sat in and drove the Lexus ""ES,"" concluding the Avalon was mo' car for less money. Now, in my case, I have little if any affection for the Lexus brand vs the Toyota ) Avalon -- so I would think of myself as opting for the Avalon seeing no advantage to the Lexus that would justify an extra charge. But, somewhere back in back of my mind, I know so many ""top class"" folks who practically worship Lexi, so were I to be faced with the choice, I imagine I would ultimately cave (and opt for the Lexus.) Funny (well sorta), I'll buy Kroger Brand every time vs the national brand if given the chance and if the Kroger Brand (pasta for instance) is cheaper. I buy Costco shirts for crissakes, but I wouldn't own a Costco gas grill -- gotta be Weber. The badges on cars and many other things (and yes we do need those stinkin' badges) are quite an important part of selecting, buying, financing and ""enjoying the ride"" [of the new 'sheen.] I have no idea why -- maybe I really have been brainwashed -- but I have no interest in a WRX at virtually any ""real life probable"" price.

In a quick 15 minutes close eyeball inspection, I was able to find at least 10 things wrong with the car. A small scuff/scratch on the black plastic windshield cowl, multiple black marks/paint blemishes on bumper edges/corners, a small minor white scratch that if not on the prior existing damage sheet, must of been caused during the shop's 38 day ownership of the car, a tiny chip on the roof, some rough slightly bumpy paint around edges such as around the fuel filling cap area, the underside of the hood has a paint blemish, and a general impression that orange peel is more prevalent or noticeable, but not bad, just not great. I was expecting all that above and I'm sure most of that can be fixed in a 2nd trip to the body shop under warranty. However, I wasn't expecting the following: Misaligned right doors (or at least the trim isn't lining up right) Haven't measured but I'd say around 3/16"" if I had to guess). Lower Rocker panel fit and finish issues (increased gap, noticeable double sided sticky tape seeping through the wide uneven gap, paint blemishes at joint) They admitted that even with a brand new rocker panel, 9 new rivets, Audi's instructions, and new double-sided sticky tape, they've never been able to match what they do in Germany. They suggest it must be installed differently in the factory. Looks aftermarket now. The exhaust was removed and reinstalled, and now both sets of exhaust tips appear to be hanging too low in relation to the back bumper diffuser, with the right two exhaust tips noticeably about 1/2""-3/4"" lower than the left pair of exhaust tips. Number 3 bothers me the most. They say if what you can see is bad and lacks QC, then perhaps what you can't see is even worse. Oh yeah, and there's still about a 4"" piece of masking tape on the lower edge of the front right door (detailer should be fired). On the other hand, the mechanical work seems solid; that's the bright side. The car drives and runs well (of course the dealership did a large portion of that work). I'd say the only thing I can tell that might be a tad ever so slightly off is the steering wheel might just be like 1 degree off-center; very close.

Here in Cincinnati, there is ONE body shop that has gone through the Audi A8 (aluminum) certification and actually sent their techs to Germany for training and then to Chicago for follow up training. I would use this body shop for any car. Oddly, my Audi dealer does NOT have a body shop, but the dealer is part of a billion dollar dealer group that has a body shop at each of their Cadillac and Acura dealerships. If I go to the dealer with a body shop need, they used to take the car to the Audi A8 certified shop -- now, unfortunately, they trot it on over to the Cadillac dealership which does a good job. Good really is the enemy of great. I had a minor hiccup (a scratch really) and ended up ""demanding"" the car go to the certified body shop. The dealer complied but not before they offered up the Cadillac (or the Acura) body shop. I had a trim piece lose its luster on my 2009 A4, and Audi agreed to send me all new chrome trim -- since it was under warranty, I let the Cadillac body shop do the job (and they replaced the trim without incident.) There was no body work or painting involved, however. If you have any Audi product, I urge you to at least investigate ONLY taking the car to an A8 certified body shop -- they seem to have been indoctrinated with the ""doing it the right way"" and good is not good enough philosophy.

4622,"April 19, 2014  5:32PM",andres3," > The S4 is a combination of aluminum, ultra high strength steel, and steel components. It appears the aluminum sub-frame of the suspension got knocked out of place affecting the left side though the impact was on the right. They said they were able to adjust it the 2nd day at the dealership to meet specs. I think unlike Toyota (in general), an Audi authorized body shop doesn't try to mess around and do things ""half-way."" There's only 3 body shops that qualify for ""Audi Certified"" in all of San Diego County. A good example is that on the first day at the dealership, they didn't try to magically adjust parts out of spec to meet spec. They admitted it didn't meet spec and worked on the car longer to get it right. In a way; this is a good thing; although my rental will now be around $1,400 due to the extended delays. I think they know the typical Audi owner is meticulous with attention to detail. After all, they didn't settle for a VW. The body shop will get the car back first thing Monday morning, do a test drive by driving the vehicle back to the shop (what happens if they wreck on the way back?) After that, he said they had a good 1.5 days of work finishing up the buffing, polishing, and detailing on the panels that were repainted (a majority of panels by the way due to blending). I hope I don't face delays like you did, because the more that is eaten up by rental costs out of the guy's $10K insurance limit, the harder it will be for me to collect decent diminished value. When I told Geico to put what they told me over the phone in writing (that they'd defer to me to be made whole first from the 10K, then come in afterwards), they balked. They said let's wait and see what Mercury agrees to pay for DV and other things first, then we'll talk. I sent a demand letter to Mercury for 15% of the total purchase price $55K (including fees/taxes) = $8,250 for DV alone. I added a caveat that this was to settle fast and quickly without me having to pay professional appraisers and incur additional costs.

4634,"April 14, 2014  8:59PM",markcincinnati,"Acura TLX There are (were) many good things to be said (and enjoyed) about the current TL SH-AWD (in Advance trim) -- trouble is (was) I often found myself ""apologizing"" for the Acura's styling and ""cheap looking"" (for the class it was aspiring to compete in) ""over-Honda-ized"" interior. The concept version is quite the step up in the styling department; but, I think the same can be said for the Infiniti Q50, too. And, well, talk about piling on -- the Q50 can't get NO love from NOBODY, well maybe a little bit from Popular Mechanics. I did then and still do today liken the TL in SH-AWD Advance form as Acura's S4 (for a lot less $). Now that I have a '14 S4, I do appreciate it [the S4] even more -- but the inherent goodness of the TL SH-AWD remains and, hopefully, will continue and grow in the updated TLX. If the price of the TLX SH-AWD Advance can stay under $50K, it ought to be a winner just so long as it [the TLX] doesn't lose the performance bits and driver involvement of the outgoing TL (this -- reduced driver involvement -- seems to be the main complaint about the Q50, as I recall). I had thought Acura had all but given up wanting to compete with the premium Germans and the other premium Japanese offerings. It would seem the TLX could knock the Q50 to last place and maybe even breathe down the IS 350's neck (assuming the Acura in FWD trim is not compared with the IS in either rear or AWD configuration). Perhaps things will get interesting again -- it was starting (for a while there) to look like the IS was going to be the only current Japanese Premium sporty sedan. This new TLX SH-AWD could turn the corner and the tide for that matter. I'll probably not make any friends for saying this, but: in this class (A4, 3 series, C Class, ATS, IS, Q50 etc), there should be NO FWD only models (unless and only unless a customer wants to special order one). Yes, I know the A4 is offered in an FWD configuration (somewhere) -- but of the 5 or so Audi dealers I am aware of there are NO, ZERO, NONE, NADDA, FWD A4's (I don't even know if you could order one if you tried) available and the dealers have no intention of ever having one (again, assuming you can get one, even.) The new A3 and the new ""baby Benz 4-door coupe"" may come as FWD models and the dealer body may elect to stock a few to attract more potential (and younger, perhaps?) customers, and that is fine. But at the ELLPS (Premium models) RWD and/or AWD are expected -- and here in Cincinnati AWD BMW's look to overtake the RWD versions soon if they haven't already (and the AWD trend is thus in Mercedes, Cadillac, Infiniti and Lexus for many models). Having the TLX offered with FWD makes a statement -- something like ""take the 'P' out of ELLPS."" I would think it is a message Acura doesn't want to promote (given the overwhelming success -- he said sarcastically -- of the FWD RLX.) In our fair city, the Honda dealership is ""real close"" (geographically) to the Acura store -- I would think some would shop a Honda after seeing the sticker on an FWD TLX. The TLX needs to make at least good run at being a performance model -- and it will be hard pressed, today, to do that as a front driver. Of course, I could be wrong -- just not uncertain.

My dealer usually has big, invitation only rollouts with fanfare when a new model comes out. They have a string quartet, champagne, canapés, etc. They then have some of the new models for brief test drives. Last one I did was for the RLX (another nice car that's getting little love). You're an Audi aficionado. I'm a little jaded because of what happened with mine. That shouldn't detract from your obvious love of the ones you've had, and continue to have. I'm an Acura aficinado. Through BMWs, Audis, Cadillacs, etc, my Acuras are still among the best cars I've ever owned....and, like you, I've owned quite a few. Your Audi is based on a FWD architecture. Yes, Quattro alleviates much of the FWD understeer. Still, day=to-day driving? You, me, anyone else would be hard pressed to say which wheels are motivating the car. They've become quite good at taming those bugaboos. On paper at least, it looks like the new TLX will have what the Acura folks have been clamoring for. While the 4 cyl will get the lion's share of volume, I'm more interested in the SH-AWD version, as always.

4638,"April 15, 2014  2:25AM",markcincinnati,"Is there anyplace (on the web?) where the number of FWD vs Quattro Audis sold in the US can be found? I've been to Audi dealers in Dallas and there were NO FWD cars other than a TT and the previous model A3 on the lot -- AWD appears NOT to be a regional issue. The highest performance Porsches and Lambos (and even some other Italian exotics) are AWD are they not? I know that I am an Audi-biased and even German car-biased person, but I would really like to know if there are any significant number (%) of FWD Audis of any configuration sold in the US -- something (maybe emotion) tells me the number of FWD A4s, 6s. 8s, etc sold are in the single digits (%). I think it would be difficult for Audi to have achieved -- after decades and the unintended acceleration setback -- Premium status if the cars were in any significant volume FWD. This FWD issue is a problem for Acura. In the ""old days"" you needed to at least have ONE V8 in your lineup to be considered Premium; these days volumetric efficiency seems to have become an acceptable alternative to displacement, but there are Premium class identifiers that Acura seemed, for a time, to embrace and recently they seem to eschew. They may very well be reliable and durable, but they need to be more difficult to be distinguished from their more humble Honda roots. Audis, for years, were often said to be ""higher cost Vw's"" -- an A4 (called an Audi 4000 on this side of the Atlantic) was somewhat of a hard sell compared to a Passat (called a Quantum) when the Quantum had an Audi 5 cylinder while the Audi had to settle for a four-cylinder. Only when Audi decided to de-VW its cars did it begin to get the respect and pricing power to be in the premium class. Acura has (until today, hopefully) had way too much Honda in their cars -- placing them at the same place Audi was about 20 years ago. It's time for Acura to get serious, eschewing FWD in the TLX would be a good start-- Acura needs to piss or get off the pot, in crude terms, to be blunt.

In the sunny states, it's a rarity of find 4WD/AWD anything. Fact is, any Quattro A4/6 has it's beginnings as a FWD platform, just like SH AWD Acuras have their beginnings on FWD platforms. I did rent a Jetta earlier this year. There are similarities to Audi...certain switches, handles, styling (especially the center stack and dash), etc. However, this is true for many brands. I don't see GM making different window switches for Cadillac when they can use the ones from Buick, just as one example. Is a Honda a ""humble"" basis for an Acura? I dunno....depends on how you look at it. An Accord is certainly a very good starting point for an Acura. I'm excited about the upcoming TLX. As I normally do, if in a couple of years, I decide to make a trade, the TLX will be tops on my list. That's based on my experiences with both the S4 and the TL SH AWD.

4644,"April 15, 2014 12:47PM",markcincinnati,"Do the Manufacturers read our rants and raves? I shared the story of the S4 that couldn't (or wouldn't) be made right with my lawyer wife. The first thing she said was ""doesn't someone from Audi read the comments on Edmunds and Audiworld?"" She elaborated that it appears that it would be less expensive to have simply replaced the un-fixable S4 rather than have the story be posted in no small amount of detail on the web. My own questions have to do somewhat with the dealer -- who was paid at the time of sale and is paid for warranty work. You'd think the dealer, who apparently is not losing any money on this customer would be interested in going the distance to get the customer's issue resolved. If the dealer was bleeding dollar bills, I could almost understand their reluctance to throw more money (mostly represented, I would assume, by time) at the problem. Audi (and others) must have interns that read our posts, maybe even computer programs that comb the Internet looking for keywords (the Audi spiders?) and bringing stories to the attention of said interns. Unless they don't have such interns or programs, it would seem valuable -- in marketing terms alone -- to have addressed the ailing S4's issues rather than seeing them escalate to the point that the customer gives up in frustration. I mean it was not like there were ""attacks"" or rants (without substantiation) posted; no name calling, etc. So for the wholesale cost of a new car the customer good-will would have, I can imagine, offset the ill-will and frustration laid out here for all to see. The question stands -- do the manufacturers have folks who monitor what we write about their products and when there seems to be a less than positive issue, intervene? On the subject of separation (by Audi from VW or by Infiniti from Nissan, for instance), it does indeed appear that when the Premium car maximizes its separation from the more humble ""parent"" they both win. Porsche, still in not very old memory, was building a number of cars that shared way too many VW components -- and those cars were damn near crucified by the motor reviewing press (and customers). Porsche virtually stopped this practice and the market responded positively. These days there are still parts sharing (between and among car company's cousins), but when the Audi division began to separate itself further and further from VW, Audi's market and machines improved significantly. On the other side of this, Infiniti's G is born with RWD, I know of no Nissan analog, ditto the M -- but the JX was brought to market so quickly Infiniti had to base it on a Nissan product (FWD no less), and despite the JX's success (or lack of), it is probably not one of Infiniti's shining moments in marketing or manufactuing. BMW has no sub-BMW division or parent which can be said to be a strength, but also may put BMW in a precarious position in the future as we see the global consolidation of car companies gather momentum.

4646,"April 15, 2014  2:43PM",dino001," The short answer is no. The long answer is no. They don't care. As long as the sales are going up, they think everything is better than ever. Regarding your dealer appearing disinterested in fixing your car, one possible explanation is that the manufacturer pays them just enough to break even on simple clear-cut issue (remove X, put new part back), but they may not get enough money to pay for diagnostic effort required when complex systems are involved. Then there may be manufacturers policy of putting head into sand when it comes to some issues, like MMI and such. If it's not direct safety (where they may get a big slap from media and/or government), they get less incentive to actually make it work.

4648,"April 15, 2014  4:18PM",graphicguy,"dino....you are so right. I can't remember how many times I'd call the dealer to ask the status of my repairs. After several days....the answers would be something along the lines of....""we haven't received instructions on how to fix your Audi"", or....""we're waiting for parts. Might take another week"". Or, ""we haven't been given the 'go-ahead' to fix your car"". How is this possible? The car was a year into the alleged ""bumper-to-bumper"" warranty. What's to authorize? You fix it. One of the reasons I won't buy a Cadillac was the way they treated my late Mother. This was several years ago, but my Mother had bought an STS brand new. Granted, her only driving was to the hair dresser, the grocery store, the pharmacy, church on Sunday....LITERALLY A CAR DRIVEN BY A LITTLE OLD LADY. It may sit for a day or two, but it was driven at least 3-4 times/week. It kept draining the battery. Cadillac dealer kept replacing the battery. A week or two after the new one was installed, it would go dead. GM started doing the ""hokey-pokey"" with my Mother...blaming her for not driving it enough. So, she and I swapped cars. I drove her Caddy every day. Same thing happened when I drove it. After having it towed yet again to the 3rd Caddy dealer to see if they could fix it, they authorized a new battery as the ""fix"". I asked the service manager if it didn't make more sense to do a diagnostics on the electrical system to see WHY the battery was being drained. He said all GM would reimburse them for was a battery replacement. GM ended up eating that car after there was such a huge surge in the electrical system that the rear window defroster actually ""blew out"" the rear window after the surge. When the buy back was authorized, I took the Caddy to the selling dealer as GM instructed. Dropping off the keys to the GM of the dealership, he said he wished he had never sold the car to my Mother. Know what? So am I.

As I have stated to distraction, between my personal cars, company paid-for cars and my wife's cars, we've had, er, 31 Audis in our garage since late 1977. They have not all been perfect. Yet, there has never been a problem that Audi has NOT stepped up and fixed (and only one time did an Audi factory rep take a look at one of my cars, and his response was to authorize all new rotors for my braking vibration issues.) I am NOT suggesting that I know some inside information -- but how do we know the mfgrs aren't paying attention to these posts (and posts made elsewhere)? I would think the almost 100% vertical ""rise in importance"" of social media would virtually dictate that the mfgrs monitor the WWW for blogs, rants, raves, posts, tweets and so on.

4656,"April 16, 2014  3:48PM",markcincinnati,"A3, CLA, 2-Series and who knows what else will come forth? This forum, nominally, is the Entry-Level LPS forum. There is, of course, also an LPS forum. These names were fine when there was no CLA, A3, and etc. Now, we have more ""creep"" by several mfgs -- the new Mercedes C class is a big move up in its ""Premium-ness"", and even though the A4 (Audi's B class) was born in 2008, it too has upped its luxury content, and one can imagine that the upcoming calendar year 2015 A4 will take a page out of the A3's book and be pushed further upscale. The new TLX (just coming to market) is, from the pictures at least, a big step up, and the same is the case (mostly) for the other ELLPS cars. I never understood what justified the Acura TSX's inclusion as an ELLPS but I accepted it as a moderator's choice that just stuck. A discussion forum here has a pretty wide latitude for discourse when there are multiple ostensibly competing cars to be commented on -- and that is fine with me. I do think, however, that the forums that include multiple cars should include cars that are typically cross shopped. Example: I might have test driven a Ford Taurus SHO when I was looking to replace my TL SH-AWD; but this event was most likely an anomaly. The Taurus SHO is not an ELLPS by any definition I can think of, nor is it, despite its girth, a candidate for the LPS forum. Therefore, at this point, the A3 and CLA and whatever else comes out BELOW the current A4, 3 Series, TLX, S60, IS, Q50 and so on should merit their own forum. The other day, I was at my Audi dealer, looking at a heavily optioned A3 Premium+ (there is one step up from that , it is called Prestige, and one might argue the upcoming S3 might up the ante even furhter). The thing was somewhat MORE expensive than a stripped A4 Premium (quattro) model. For the time being, perhaps, folks may cross shop the NEW A3 with the OLD A4 -- the replacement A4 however will, presumably, dissipate the overlap, if not always in price, certainly in its ability to be perceived as distinctly ""more premium"" than even the top o' the heap A3. In any case, unless we want these forums to devolve into ""anything goes"", my vote is to put this new crop of sub-ELLPS cars into their own forum, perhaps something like Premium Sporty Compacts, PSC for short, or Sporty Premium Compacts, SPC, pick something, anything, just not ELLPS unless we make a new class in between ELLPS and LPS.

4693,"February 27, 2014  2:59PM",markcincinnati,"@sweendogy: I read an article about the ""individual"" settings that suggested the steering will perform at its best if set to Auto. I can't seem to locate the article, but I know it was in a fairly recent Car & Driver or Automobile or Road & Track, since those are the publications I subscribe to. I don't know if I can honestly tell much of a difference, but for what it's worth, I set mine to Dynamic, Auto & Comfort (engine/transmission, steering, exhaust sound, respectively). The primary (perhaps the ONLY) difference with the engine/transmission setting at dynamic is that the transmission will default to S mode which seems to hold in gear longer before upshift, perform obvious rev matches during downshifts and make the ""fart"" sound on upshifts more aggressive (hence my setting of ""comfort"" for the engine sound). Now that I have passed 5,000 miles I am noticing better gas mileage, improved performance and a feeling of ""less friction"" overall. I had really missed the cruise control in the Audi -- when I set the CC to, say, 45MPH in the Acura TL SH-AWD and then find myself going down a rather steep hill seeing a curve at the bottom, the Acura would start freewheeling, so to speak and pick up more and more speed (based on the grade). Then, to negotiate the turn, I would have to brake -- which turned the cruise control off, of course. In the Audi, set the CC for 45MPH and go down a virtual vertical drop and the CC holds the speed at 45MPH, period. Then when reaching the base of the downhill, I can negotiate the curve without killing the cruise control. It is a little thing, perhaps for some people. But my 2005 A6 and 2009 A4 had this feature and my 2011 Infiniti and 2012 Acura did not -- it seemed [on those Japanese premium cars] like a huge oversight. Another thing I like about the Audi CC is if you've set it, say, at 75MPH and you come into a heavily monitored construction zone where the speed limit is reduced to 55MPH, you can toggle the CC stalk to 55 and the car brakes and resets itself at 55. With the Acura, for instance, you could only coast down or apply the brakes yourself. I know there will be folks who are dead set against the car having this much ""intelligence"" or autonomy (and this ain't THAT much, folks), but it can simply be turned off if you don't want to ""enjoy"" a tiny bit smarter cruise control. In any case, I keep forgetting just how much technology comes with these German cars -- and how it does its best to help you not get ticketed and remain in control. I give this feature alone an ""A"" for its contribution to safety.

4696,"February 27, 2014  8:10PM",markcincinnati,"The Audi's backup camera screen shows trajectory lines that ""curve"" as the steering wheel is turned. The Acura? Straight lines, no curve, no match to steering wheel inputs. Now, the Infiniti, it had front camera and rear camera and trajectory lines when the car was in reverse and drive -- of course, it also had the wonderful, fantastic, gotta have it, around-view monitor. Of course now both Audi and BMW offer this tech, but it is still not universal. Of course, I recently read an article about how many times backup camera adoption has been pushed to a future year -- I guess we should feel good that the German and Japanese (premium) cars typically come standard with such tech and that it is pretty much ""available"" on the lesser cars from that mfgr. Looks like backup cameras are ""probably"" going to be required as of January 2015 -- but don't hold your breath. By the time the backup camera is a requirement, the all-around or top-view systems will be the norm in the premium segment. If you've not seen what an all-around top-view, etc, set-up can do, check out your nearest Infiniti showroom -- this is seriously cool tech that makes driving and parking in tight spaces, oh, only about a MILLION PERCENT easier and safer! I graduated from college in 1973 (yep, I am old) and I took a course in 1971 where a new technology was introduced (in a Chrysler, no less): anti-lock brakes. 1971. Let that sink in -- the first car I was personally aware of that could actually have ABS as it came to be called was a 1985 model year BMW ""7"" series which, as I recall, came to the US market in calendar 1984. What in the wide-wide world of sports took 13 years [for anti-lock brakes] to go from Chrysler (std equipment on the gas-turbine car they produced) to BMW (probably sourced from Bosch). The year following, ABS was offered on the Audi 200 (US name 5000S) quattro (and probably the FWD version too for that matter.) Yet, when was it that mere mortals could get ABS on their Blue Ovals and Bow Ties? It seems like it took decades! Of course it took another automotive eternity to make ESP widely available, too. To a certain extent Audi took a helluva long time to bring ""torque vectoring"" (aka ""sport differential"") to market -- doing so, I believe, sometime after Acura announced their version of torque vectoring with the mouthful of a name -- SH-AWD. I've had ABS, ESP, TPMS, sat nav, voice activation, blind spot monitoring, bi-xenon head-lights (except for the Acura), back-up or all-around view cameras and monitors and a whole host of other ""ought to be standard equipment"" stuff for longer than I can remember (and it is not -- yet -- due to a fading memory); this stuff is very cheap to make and probably all of this technology can fit in the space of one chip, with room to spare, these days. Why does the trickle down or even just the offering of the technology move at glacial speed for pity's sake? Another technology that ""ought to be standard"" is the 7, 8 or 9 (or more) speed transmission. I believe a base 4-cylinder 2010 Audi A4 was offered with an 8-speed tiptronic transmission; and, I believe every or virtually every BMW can be had with an 8 speed unit, too. The 8-speed's reason for being is economy and performance, yes? Why didn't Chevy -- to name one -- do what these Germans did: go to ZF and buy the 8-speed units and tout their benefits in their brand new Impalas and SS's and, same question for Ford. The efficiency and performance gains alone should have made this worth doing -- instead we've got a whole bunch of new ""made in the USA"" cars with ""old"" 6-speed transmissions.

4700,"February 28, 2014  3:19PM",markcincinnati,"Glad to see ""us"" scratching our heads wondering why the nearly 13 year gap between working ABS in a Chrysler (I think it was only 2-channel ABS, but hey it worked) and the German's putting it in their top of the line models. I had a 1986 Audi 5000CS quattro and it had ABS -- indeed, it had an ""off on"" ABS switch on the dash. The owner's manual explained when ABS worked and when it was best to turn it off. Of course they took the switch away when they found out that sometimes people would turn ABS off at inappropriate times because they thought there was something wrong with their brakes since they ""pulsed"" when ABS was activated. A case of ignorance winning out over technology. According to the owner's manual, you should turn your ABS off when driving in deep gravel or deep not packed (fluffy) snow, since you could use a locked wheel/tire to slow you down in deep gravel since a mound of gravel would pile up under the tires rapidly shedding speed. The mound-ing effect was cancelled by the action of the ABS, making the stopping more difficult in deep snow or gravel. In any case, my confusion and perhaps even frustration is with the slow adoption of tech that is actually very inexpensive. And American mfgrs are some of the worst offenders. Hell, they'll jump on putting power windows in an el cheapo car, but delay for decades incorporating ABS, ESP, blind spot monitoring, etc etc etc. I would assume the cost of the hardware for power windows, power sunroofs and power door locks is more than the cost of a backup camera and blind spot monitoring, for example. I'm pretty confident that the reason for the delay has something to do with perceived demand, costs and what the mfgr must see as their customers' perception of the value of such tech. To me, this [safety and/or performance and/or convenience] tech is almost essential any more. Even though I think factory sat nav is outrageously priced, I wouldn't leave home without it -- but c'mon to add ""MMI"" to an Audi is $3,500 -- and for that you get sat nav, bluetooth and voice activation of several of the car's systems -- all nicely integrated. This has to provide Audi with a super high gross margin -- and, even knowing that, the majority of cars my Audi dealer sells (which are overwhelmingly Q5s and A4s) come with MMI, ""because that's what people want."" Maybe things like ABS, when they were a $500 option, just didn't seem sexy enough, no matter how little it cost. Of course, now we're moving into a whole new era of auto tech -- autonomy. . . .

4701,"February 28, 2014  6:56PM",dino001,"I think the issue was perception of safety as a priority. At that time it was not not perceived as such and stereo or power windows sold well, whereas ABS or airbags were considered ""fluff"". There were many examples of drivers choosing entertainment, or convenience options over safety when it was done as an alternative of ""free upgrade"", or simple limit of total price. It changed today, but it is still expected to be ""free"". In other words ABS or stability control should be ""free"" (i.e. included in price that is same as last year model), but leather or premium stereo, no problem as an option. To best see how peoples' preferences changed is to watch evolution of Toyota cars. Toyota has almost six sense, when it comes to timing standard inclusion of equipment in the model vs. market demands. When Toyota offers something standard, it means the segment requires that as such. When it is still an expensive option, it means people will either be willing to pay extra or so without it.

4735,"February 25, 2014 10:31PM",markcincinnati,"5,000 Miles Down the Road A friend of mine, a marketing executive for a national software firm, always buys BMW’s and claims Audis are exclusively for “left-brainers” (I started out life as a computer programmer, so maybe there is something to that) because they appeal to technical types (tech-weenies, to quote my friend); you know these folks, those people who not only can create elaborate spreadsheets with impossible formulas, but also who can write actual computer programs as well. My wise-guy friend claims, even though Audi engines, transmissions and sumptuous interiors are either proclaimed by the motoring press to be “the best” or at least “tied for the top,” Audis remain soul-less machines, sorely lacking the all-important emotional hook to keep “serious” car people interested and perhaps entertained. They (Audis) are extremely competent and confidence inspiring pieces of machinery, but they somehow are not the stuff that inspires passionate prose – even though they are often the winners of three, four and five-way motoring press “comparo” reports. Although I, apparently, am in the minority who do not doubt Audi’s soul can be seen, heard and felt in its cars, I now present an S4 update now that I have passed 5,000 miles – much of it being driven in sub-freezing weather and on snow and ice-covered roads. The Audi in question is an Ibis white 2014 S4 Premium Plus model with the 7-speed S-Tronic transmission, 18” wheels shod with all-season tires, MMI/Navigation+, B&O audio, Magma Red Napa leather seats, carbon fiber trim, Audi side assist and Audi Care. I guess, perhaps I even wish, I would have gone for the Prestige model, now that I think of it, just for the articulating headlights. Of course now that I know how inexpensive the sport differential is, I should have insisted on getting that, too. With shipping and Audi Care, the pre-tax price was $57+K. As a member of the Audi Club of North America, I got an “automatic” 6% off the sticker, and as an Ohio resident, had to pay 6.5% sales tax. I put no money down and leased the car. I plan to buy the car and the Audi extended service package, if it proves itself to be as durable as it is fun to drive. I believe there is a way, too, to CPO my own car (for a price) giving me a warranty to 100,000 miles. At 5,000 miles the first service – basically an inspection and an oil and filter change – is required, subsequent service intervals are 10,000 miles. First off, the car has had no issues of any kind beyond a flat tire which only required a patch to remedy. Even on the coldest mornings (minus 11 F), starting was no problem and since I have heated seats there was only short-lived temperature discomfort. My butt was quickly warmed up, that is. Second, the S4 with the S-Tronic transmission is beyond a pleasure to drive – it goes all the way to fun to drive coupled with a boatload of confidence inspiration. The engine, transmission, brake and steering combination work together so well they have convinced me they are telepathic, responding to my foot and hand commands in real time. There is no latency: Press the accelerator and the car doesn’t pause that millisecond every other car I have ever had did, indeed it seems to accelerate almost a millisecond before my brain receives the confirmation from my foot that the pedal has been pressed. The paddle shifters, too, act, they don’t react – when I ask for an upshift, the speed at which the next highest gear is selected is faster (and smoother) even than the best manual transmission upshift, I could ever pull off. And, I should also tell you that the brakes slow or stop the car with such speed and control it is as if I had hit a giant, super-thick foam rubber wall. Finally, the S4 goes where you point it, when you point it. Body roll is minimal and it corners like a Ken Onion chef’s knife carves a tender beef roast. Other than the unabashed fart-like exhaust sound that accompanies high RPM upshifts, the S4 is very quiet and civilized inside, and the tuneage delivered through the B&O speaker system is sick – although I do miss the extra kick from the sub-woofer in the Acura TL’s DVD-Audio system. This year, Drive Select is standard, and it allows, in Individual mode, the driver to change the characteristics of the engine/transmission, steering and exhaust system sound. Settings generally include Comfort, Auto and Dynamic. I have mine set for Dynamic (engine/transmission), Auto (steering) and Comfort (exhaust note sound), although under full-throttle, even in Comfort mode, the engine growls and the exhaust snorts right on cue whenever the transmission upshifts. I have no intention of taking this (or my wife’s SQ5) to the track, but wrist-watch timed runs from 0 to 60 are, always under 5-seconds. To me, the S4 is a rocket in terms of its quickness; I’ll not be chipping this engine – it doesn’t need it. Time and distance take on entirely new meanings with an S4 – something I do attribute partially to the wonderful (Red) sport seats. Nobody does sport-seats better than Audi. In sum, at 5,000 miles the already quick S4 engine seems to have found and made available about 5% more horsepower and torque from just above idle on to redline. I will look forward to repeating this “+5%” phenomenon again, if all goes as usual, again at 10,000 miles. Perhaps because S4’s are not typically plentiful at your local dealer – there are rarely more than one or two of them at any of the Audi dealers I’ve been to over nearly three decades, they are “outta sight and outta mind” for many premium sport-sedan shoppers. This is a pity, for the S4 is that rare automobile that artfully combines, sport, luxury and a fair amount of practicality (it is in one of American’s most sought after configuration – a four-door sedan) in one fun package. If your auto shopping list currently includes an Acura TLX [coming soon], BMW 335, Infiniti Q50S, Cadillac ATS, Lexus IS 350 F-Sport, Mercedes C-class or Volvo S60 Type-R, you owe it to yourself to take a long test drive in an Audi S4. If money is an object, I would assume a great second choice would be the upcoming TLX, assuming Acura keeps the S4-lite theme of the current TL SH-AWD alive and well. Or, you could get an A4 S-Line and have many of the same goodies that make the S4 such a treat.

I didn't get the job because I questioned the way I'd be paid. It was to be a $200 per week base and then I'd get paid more based on a CSI score. I asked how my pay would be affected if someone's iDrive crashed before try got their survey. That was a chance I couldn't take living in Manhattan trying to support myself. @qbrozen My Dad had an '07 X5 which was the 1st car BMW introduced with the ""beer tap shifter."" One morning in a snow storm, he drove over a 2 x 4 (that he couldn't see). The ""low coolant"" light went on, so he pulled over, shut the truck off, and looked to see if there was any coolant spewing out from underneath it. He lifted the hood and everything looked OK. He fired the X5 back up and was about to head to the dealer, when he looked down at the dash and the low coolant light wasn't on anymore. So he continued on his way to work. Now I have to tell you that my Dad travels back and forth to work with his 2 Great Danes. He keeps a piece of plywood over the folded rear seats to keep his truck cleaner. Anyway, its snowing, it's 6:30 AM, and my Dad's X5 literally shuts off in the middle of the Tappan Zee Bridge. I'm cleaning off my Prelude getting ready to go to work and I see he keeps calling me. Maybe he plans to tell me about an accident on the way (we work together)? I listen to the voice mail, he says: ""call me, I'm stuck on the bridge."" I call him back and he tells me the story, then asks: ""how do I get this thing into neutral so the thruway authority can load it on the flatbed?"" He checks the owner's manual. Without the owner's manual we sold have never figured out: Remove the cup holder, remove the piece under the cup holder, remove red ""T"" key from the spare tire compartment. Stick the red ""T"" key into the square hole underneath the cup holders and twist to release the transmission so vehicle can be loaded on to flatbed. Just a few problems, he had to get out of the car in the snow on a bridge (cars flying by on the driver's side & the Hudson River on the passenger side). Open the rear lift gate to get to the ""T"" key where the spare tire is seems easy enough, except it was under a piece of plywood perfectly cut to fit the rear of the X5. The tow truck drivers from the NYS Thruway Authority can't help him because every time they try to help my Dad pick up the plywood, his 140 lb Great Danes start barking and scare the pants off the poor guys.",cleaner never id danes listen holder shifter im storm pulled forth week river barking hood qbrozen previous truck ok chance scare easy continued cup asked perfecacuray voice take head guys work folded keep secadillac ready performance great every dealer low open except 2002 140 200 idrive stick fired drivers authority 4 see back plans side geaudiing x keeps piece thruway lb fit anyway plywood base affected spare flying pay didnt story generation owners went light support problems mail trying snowing literally maybe spewing 07 loaded tow start nissanioned bmw 1st neutral lift checks morning manhaaudian everything position tell together without dads snow call shut specialist wasnt flatbed key pick survey beer lifted tappan job compartment dad load coolant prelude twist performance gate hole score couldnt stuck tells passenger shuts someones pants underneath try cleaning vehicle time would per get series square seems interviewed csi cut remove figured drove hudson release asks cant calling actually way console holders cars accident paid crashed tap got safety living help bridge nys rear looked 630 zee go red delivery says become one sold poor thing 7 travels based enough anymore car 2 manaaudian middle kyfdx introduced

However, we won’t have to wait too long to see the car revealed, according to the latest reports. Just-Auto, based on an interview with Jaguar design boss Ian Callum, is reporting that the new car, rumored to be called the XS, will be revealed as early as this summer. This suggests that we could see it, or at least a concept version, unveiled at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in late June, the Brit event where last year Jaguar presented its Project 7 concept car. During the same interview, Callum is also reported to have said that Jaguar is planning facelifts for several models, including the recently launched F-Type range. Though he didn’t confirm plans for any other models, we know due to test mule sightings that Jaguar is also working on a new crossover as well as a next-generation XF. As for the XS, it is based on the aforementioned iQ[Al] structure, a lightweight aluminum design that will incorporate a new family of four-cylinder engines called the Hotfire series.

OK, OK, not literally another actual car, rather the Audi break-in part one (~5,000 miles) and a check up and oil change at the dealer. This 2014 Audi S4 is like every other Audi I've had since 1977 -- you end up getting a new car (on the day you pick it up) and then you get another ""new car"" at 5,000 and around 10,000 miles as the engine seems to really get stronger and stronger. We've had the worst winter here in SW Ohio in what seems like decades (some local weather types have said this has been one of our worst in over 20 years) and I felt no need to swap tires. The all-seasons that the car came with had zero problems. My wife's SQ5 (purchased about 6 weeks or so after my S4) has 20"" Continental Extreme DWS all seasons (UHP too) and she's has no traction issues either. I watch the man screaming QUATTRO!!!! on the commercial told from the POV of a tow-truck driver and we are living proof of the prowess of the quattro AWD system. Sweendogy, I suspect there isn't too much different between your 2013 S4 and my '14, other than the fact that you were able to pay less -- I hope your car is under warranty and is CPO'd, which should at least provide you with the peace of mind (financially) you want. I'll bet any repairs on an S4 out of warranty will be breathtakingly expensive (shudder.) I finally saw my first SQ5 (other than my wife's) a couple of days ago -- and, finally, finally, saw my first Q50 at long last. Boy, the sales on that one must be slow; I've seen several Lexus IS's though, making me think that one has been a heckuva lot more successful in the market. The new TLX (show car) actually seems pretty attractive -- although I don't really miss my '12 TL, I don't have any real complaints about it now that it's gone -- the S4 is a totally different experience, but, to my dying day, I do think Acura's TL SH-AWD was their version of an S4 (for a lot less $). I sat in an S6 at the dealer recently -- now that may be my new Batmobile -- but, hey, for $80,000+ it ought to be. Anyone have the sales figures for 2013 and so far in 2014 for our list of ELLPS cars? I'd love to see how the IS, Q50, TL, A4/S4, etc did and are selling.

4833,"February 18, 2014  3:56PM",markcincinnati,"The ONLY Audi I had that really, truly SCARED me, with respect to reliability, durability and co$t to keep post-warranty, was my 1997 A8. The thing, in warranty thankfully, kept having failure after failure of ""little and medium"" components. I didn't have engine or transmission problems, but I suspect things like the motors (and it had a bunch of them) that controlled the seats, seat belt height and on and on, just kept failing (and being replaced again and again.) My subsequent Audi was a 2000 A6 4.2, which had brake rotor issues -- but nothing else other than routine mntce to speak of; same thing with my 2001 A6 4.2, brake rotors and everything else was solid. Since then, my 2003 allroad, 2005 A6 3.2, 2009 A4 2.0T and my current 2014 S4 all seemed to me (pretty early on the S4 though) to be reliable. My 2005 A6, which I kept to about 66,000 miles as I recall, also would make me say ""durable."" Yet, these days with several of the Japanese maker's cars easily going 150,000 miles with ""routine"" mntce, 66K miles hardly is proof positive. One of the people I work with has a 2005 BMW 5 series and he did buy the extended SERVICE package when he purchased the car new. This was NOT a warranty -- just an extended ""factory"" mntce policy. After 50K miles, these German cars often require wholesale replacement of ""stuff"" in the name of service (maintenance, i.e.) Audi, too, offers extended mntce (for a price) and there is some procedure you can go through to get your own car CPO'd (again, for a price) which takes the warranty to 100,000 miles (up to 6 years from first date of use). After 100K miles, however, you're on your own. Here is the thing my friend has found with his BMW -- with his extended service contract in hand, he was able to have a fully paid off car with no added service charges for about 2 years. Then, after the service contract died, he did have some on-going (fairly expensive) service or repairs (it is hard to know, sometimes what is ""broken"" and what is just ""time to replace""), but the cost of the repairs at MAX was $1,400 and typically was $100-$300 -- and didn't actually happen frequently. So, the cost of having a very well maintained, comfortable, good performing 2005 5 series was, at most, $2,000 in one year, typically half that. When I get in his 2005 BMW, I can tell it isn't as up to date (with respect to the electronics for instance) as a 2014 Audi S4, but overall it is still clearly a very nice performance/luxury car that when detailed looks in near showroom condition and is cheap to own. I'm looking forward to the latter -- even though I do love to keep up with all the new-tech. I'm driving my wife's 2014 SQ5 Prestige today -- wow, in some respects I like it better than my S4! Of course the S4 has the S-tronic transmission which has to be driven to be believed.

4866,"January 29, 2014  8:19PM",markcincinnati,"Regarding the statements: "" BMW probably does the most to subsidize their leases. I think Mercedes does, too."" And: ""I wouldn't call it subsidizes they have programs..."" Well, the truth of the matter is that BMW [among others] does provide ""financial support"" for leases made through their financial companies. This support is often (usually) called a ""sub-vented lease."" Subventing makes leasing more attractive to the buyer who doesn't care so much about the MSRP of a given vehicle, but does care about the monthly payment. Either a purchase or a lease ""deal"" can be subvented -- but the real impact of subventing is going to be able to be much greater for a lease than a loan. The best thing that can be done regarding a loan to buy a new car is that the interest rate charged can be set to zero (0% apr). This way a $36,000 car can be purchased and the payments determined by dividing $36,000 by the number of months that payments will be made. $36,000 divided by 36 months, then, equals DOH! a $1,000 per month payment. I assume we could stretch the point and say that the manufacturer could offer a ""loyalty"" or ""conquest"" or even a ""just because"" bonus or rebate or discount of $1,000, making the amount financed be only $35,000, meaning the payment would be $35,000 divided by 36 months or $972.22/month. A subvented lease, on the other hand, is where the mfg can really influence your ""purchase"" decision. Here's why. When you lease a new car, the payment will be determined (generally speaking) by several things: 1.The % of value (residual value) that the car will have at the end of the lease 2.The money factor (think of it as the interest rate) that is used. Roughly speaking you can calculate the lease payment (remember the word ""roughly"") by subtracting the residual value from the MSRP of the car to get your anticipated usage cost. If the car is $36,000 and its residual is 50%, your usage over 36 months is $18,000. If you put money (out of your pocket) as what you might term a ""down payment"" you will reduce the amount of the ""agreement"" by that amount (this is called a capitalized cost reduction). This ""down payment"" [in your mind] does not reduce the residual value of the car, meaning that if you decided to buy the car at the end of the lease the amount you will have to come up with will still be $18,000. Please, don't call any money down on a conventional (closed-end) lease a down payment and I won't either. It is a ""cap cost reduction"" -- and the purpose of this cap cost reduction is solely to reduce the monthly payment. You are NOT building up any value, post lease, whatsoever. The money factor (or the implied cost of money -- or interest rate) is applied to recognize the value of the ""time"" you have the auto mfg's finance arm's money tied up. Far more detailed explanations -- and explanations that are specific to your lease deal -- are available here on Edmunds and of course at your dealership. The bottom line, however, is this: the auto manufacturer's financial outlet may offer a lease to you that has been subvented by the manufacturer. The subventing can take the form of: A reduction of the money factor -- including taking it to zero; or, An increase of the residual % -- including taking it to a very optimistic % (+5% or even more) -- meaning the car will be said to be worth a much larger percentage of its brand new value than market conditions would likely support. This manipulation of the residual cannot be done when the car is financed outright -- so perhaps you can see that a subvented lease could produce a very very low monthly payment if the mfg decides to reduce the money factor to zero or near zero and increases the residual value significantly over the expected depreciation. Subvented leases often carry with them terms that are not as ""friendly"" to you as a straight buy with a loan or a lease that has not been subvented. If the manufacturer says the residual is 62% after 36 months and the reality of the situation is that the 36 month value should only be 55%, you may not be able to get out of your lease early without a huge $ penalty (plus perhaps a standalone early termination fee or penalty). If you buy and finance a car, you can sell or trade you car almost at any time and only pay the potential difference between the outstanding loan amount and the amount you can sell the car for. It may feel like a prepayment penalty, but the reality is that there will be no literal prepayment penalty (it is uncommon for an auto loan from a bank, for instance, to have a prepayment penalty -- if you want to get out of the loan, you can sell the car and give the proceeds to the bank plus a bit more out of your pocket or perhaps a check from the bank.) So, leases give, leases take. Leases are sometimes of the very, very low payment variety -- meaning there is some subventing going on and suggesting that you'd better be prepared to not fall out of love with your new baby for ""about 90%"" of the lease's term. I say that because it is also common practice to put customers in 39 month leases and then around month 33 start to seduce ""owners"" into the showrooms with the promise of letting them out of their leases without penalties if they re-lease the new model. BMW does have a reputation -- I assume well founded -- for ""supporting"" (subventing) leases. This can make getting into a $50,000 Bimmer ""within reach."" It also pretty much locks customers into the cycle of ""lease, burn through the lease, and re-lease"" again and again. Nothing wrong with that for a lot of consumers. But not for all. If you want to keep your car 5 years or longer, you may not find leasing economics works for you; If you drive more than 18,000 miles per year (and probably the message could be ""more than 15,000 miles per year), you may not find leasing economics works for you (as your residual will likely drop sharply, meaning the monthly payment will rise sharply in response); If you own a business, on the other hand, leasing may mean you can ""expense your lease payment"" to the company (with proper and available proof), which many would consider to be a good thing; If you want to build equity in your car, well that is ""highly"" (or at least ""fairly"") unlikely in a leased car, but more likely in a car that you are making payments on to buy. And the pros of leasing AND buying go on. Neither my wife nor I had ever purchased a car, until late 2013 when we bought her '14 Audi SQ5 Prestige; we also lease a '14 Audi S4 (and are fully intending, 4 months into the lease, to buy the thing at the end of the lease -- and we put NO money down on the lease). This is a new experience for us and we keep rationalizing that -- at this time -- buying (for us) will likely turn out to be a better deal since we intend on keeping the cars more than 5 years. So, my point in all that is above is this: Auto manufacturers DO indeed provide financial subsidies (i.e., named subvented lease programs). Multiple security deposits are NOT, strictly speaking, subsidies, however.

I am a manual trasmission guy, my current and last three cars have had manual transmission, but diesel engine is probably LEAST fun and LEAST suitable with manual trasmission for a passenger car (it's a little different for towing vehicles and tractor trailers with 10-12 gear manuals used to crawl uphill or just maximize efficiency). This holiday I drove again (just like last year) my dad's Audi A4 with 1.9 TDI and manual transmission (it has sports suspension, too) and it was not a fun car, not to me anyway. The reason? Simple - diesel powerband is so narrow and short that I had to constantly shift up and down even on straight roads (just slight speed variation made it uncomfortable, if the car was on wrong gear). Ramp merging was a bit less scary than last year (as I got used to it and learned a little), but nevertheless couldn't hold a candle to a nice gasoline engine of similar power (even lower torque), when you can keep your car on same gear up to 5K+ rpm and keep accelerating. Diesel nicely kicks the speed up, but then equally suddenly dies in the middle of the manouver making you shift at least comfortable moment and lose time/distance. If there is one type of passenger car that I don't mind well spaced and timed multigear automatic (or CVT), it is exactly small diesel.

4879,"January 22, 2014  3:31PM",dino001," Well, I guess, our priorities are simply different. I'm sure it probably lies in one's definition of ""fun"" and what each of us considers a good experience. My point of reference for MT experience are good gasoline engines with long powerbands and decent torque (WRX, STI, 328), to which diesel simply cannot hold a candle in terms of driving satisfaction. I talked to many owners of diesels in Europe and ""fun"" is not even in their vocabulary. Their reasons of getting diesel is plain and simple - money. I consider current 328d a first BMW's legitimate entry in terms of economizing fuel efficiency, Such consideration was not as important in the past, but I guess times change, more and more marginal customers buy those things, so lowering their cost of ownership is one way of expanding the market opportunity. I think the 8AT is just right for it. I don't think 6MT would be any better in terms of driving experience and it would not provide any fuel economy savings. It might provide potential for better durability, but I didn't hear of massive failures of those BMW's autos. I may be misinformed, of course. The background of European popularity of diesel does not lie in its inherent ""fun"", or otherwise superior performance. It is a plain fuel economy advantage traded for clunky sound, higher noise, lower powerband. The diesel engines went long way from times when they were very slow and had unbearable vibrations. Today's turbos fixed that off-line acceleration problem - in fact the punch provided by diesel is better than gasoline - the only thing is it doesn't last. The maintenance seems to be more of an issue today, that's the price paid for better engine. The engines reportedly do not last as long as they used to, they are more sensitive to fuel quality, which can be a problem in certain areas and repair costs are massive. To be fair, that's true about all cars, not just diesels. In the world of $8-10/galon fuel (today's prices in Euro zone), every drop counts, so getting your car going further has real financial consequences, even for more affluent people. Only richest of the rich don't have to factor that in, the rest needs to consider if the great gasoline V6/I6, so popular with many Americans (not to mention V8), is affordable. Memo: it is not. Thus, the second and real only choice becomes a decent diesel. Prior recent boom, diesel fuel was also considered a lower grade byproduct and it was taxed less, creating a double bang for a buck (higher mpg on lower priced fuel).

4880,"January 22, 2014  3:40PM",markcincinnati,"Regarding Diesels & Transmissions post (above): I suppose there is some chance that the manual transmission ""option"" will soldier on, probably for several more years. However, the manual transmission is, sadly, on its death-bed. Sadly? Sure, sadly -- because manual transmission cars (or more accurately said ""some"" manual transmission equipped cars) generally speaking are more fun to drive; and, until recently manual transmission cars provided real, measurable benefits simply unavailable with even the best transmissions that shift(ed) themselves. Today, however, the manual transmission crowd, of which I consider myself to be a member, really doesn't have any attribute (that can be measured) that makes it ""better"" than some automatics. And, the thing is, even those automatics which are inferior -- today -- to a stick-shift, will likely soon be replaced with incrementally better autos until virtually all the automatic transmissions on the market are equal to or better than manuals. Then, as a natural progression, all automatics offered will render manuals measurably inferior -- leaving only ""fun-to-drive"" as their reasons for being. Of course, in the ELLPS and LPS world, at least, manuals will simply no longer be offered as the upcoming crop of drivers is both unfamiliar with manuals (read: unable to drive them) and really confused as to why anyone would even want to shift a car. We are progressively moving toward the autonomous automobile -- at least if you believe the story on CBS's Sunday Morning program where the new autonomous technologies were put on display courtesy of Mercedes (and Volvo and, and, and). Manual transmissions, like light beers, are dead and they just don't know it yet. I used to jump in a cab in Munich (often a light yellow Mercedes) and most of the time it was a manual transmission diesel version of the MB E Class. These days -- well since 2005 -- most of the cabs are as noted but with automatic transmissions. My assumption is, this can be seen as a bellwether -- either a predictor or cause-agent of things that will ""soon"" be adopted universally. My 1995 Audi S6 was ONLY available with a manual transmission; I can't even imagine a 2014 S6 so equipped -- and, frankly, despite my ""fun-to-drive"" comments, I can't even imagine I would want a 2014 S6 with a manual trans. How many of the ELLPS and LPS cars on the market are even offered with an ""optional"" manual transmission? Or perhaps the more pertinent question is what is the % of manual transmission versions of these ELLPS and LPS cars that are sold (at least in the US, anyway)? I would be pleasantly shocked to hear almost any number greater than 2%. The economics of offering an auto and a manual version are, likewise, already in play -- if a German manufacturer has to certify both a manual and an auto version of a model to be able to sell them in the US (and elsewhere, I'd imagine), my guess is they will simply decide there is no economic justification for certifying a model that represents but a tiny portion of sales, no matter what we say here, or no matter what the editors and writers of Car & Driver, et al, [non-permissible content removed] about.

I am going to assume the engineers and designers at Acura have banished as much of the ""Honda Effect"" as possible. I see no harm in some power train sharing, for example, but Acura needs to be a brand that stands out as a Brand, not just an upscale Honda. For years (and I know since I owned examples of both brands), it was quite easy to see the resemblance and lineage of Audi and VW. I assume it was Audi who made the decision to ""go their own way"" not the other way around. The result has been beneficial to both brands. The new Q50 (recently reviewed -- and not all that favorably -- on MotorWeek) got the style right as far as I am concerned. The 3.7L engine has been made to feel much smoother and the interior is more upscale befitting Infiniti's aspirations. Thus far, however, the reviews of the Q50 have been, well, underwhelming. I suspect the driving dynamics that the experts loved in the G37 will need to return and be improved upon sooner rather than later. The IS from Lexus -- in IS 350 F Sport trim -- seems to have gotten everything right, not so much however the lesser IS's, especially the 250 which has recently been given mostly ""thumb's down."" Now, along comes Acura with what appears to be a sparkling, spanky new TL(X). Acura, for the past few years, has been apparently wandering aimlessly (with the exception of the MDX, one of Acura's 'reasons for being') -- are they a Premium car-line or are they drifting further away with each passing year (a halo car, which is looking good, ain't enough to redeem them, yet). This new TLX is, from the web pictures a looker -- and the marketing message is pretty darn strong. Like the Q50 and the IS 350 F Sport, however, the proof will be when the automotive press gets their hands on the thing in several states of trim. Despite my ""one and done"" Acura TL SH-AWD flirtation and my subsequent return to Audi (with an S4 none the less), I did think the Acura was a decent attempt at creating an ELLPS; I still think the 2012 and newer Acura TL SH-AWD models were Acura's S4, and a high value vehicle, too. So, here's hoping Acura's glintzy (a made up word) new TLX lives up to our expectations as well as its press release. As Van Morrison said (adapted here to mean ""These are the days to be in the market for a new ELLPS""): ""These are the days, the time is now There is no past, there's only future There's only here, there's only now.""

4945,"January 15, 2014  9:52PM",graphicguy," I believe Acura was pretty early to the 300+ HP V6 party. I know my Mustang GT SOHC V8 had 300 HP less than 10 years ago. BMW is still touting their twin scroll turbo 6 as 300 HP (albeit I suspect that's under rated). The Lexus (x)S 350 V6 is right at that mark, too. The Infiniti V6 in the Q/G sedans have more HP, but are down on torque compared to the Acura V6. Audi uses a S/C on their 6 cyl, and is a great performer. Their 4 cyl is 220HP but is torquey. So, I think Acura is dead on if they end up with a 210-230 HP 4 cyl and a 310-320 HP V6. Again, 8 sp DCT or 9 sp transmissions put them right at the front of the class, too. Mark, I don't think Acura gives up anything to the Audi's interior in materials, build, or functionality. Like you, I've owned both.

4963,"December 23, 2013  8:45PM",markcincinnati,"I have, in this forum, shared my experiences with my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance. I did suggest that I understood and largely agreed with the July '10 Automobile comparison of a TL (SH-AWD) with an Audi S4 (with the sport differential – Audi's torque vectoring rear diff). Refresher (from Automobile, July 2010): “You probably never thought of the Acura TL SH-AWD and the Audi S4 on the same day, much less in the same sentence. . . .significantly, they both use torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive systems to ensure that they don't sacrifice one iota of the corner-carving thrills you've grown to love.” “In a [non-permissible content removed]-for-tat comparison between two cars that share the same driveline philosophy, it quickly becomes obvious that the Acura and the Audi are significantly different only in the details.” Now, with 3,000+ miles on my '14 S4 and after 40,000+ miles with my TL, I can offer my 2¢ more. First, let’s get the “as owned “ MSRP’s out there. With rear parking sensors, upgraded tires (UHP a/s's) and splash guards, the TL SH-AWD Advance comes in a bit south of $48,000. Approximately comparably equipped (but sans the sport differential) the S4 Premium+ easily sweeps past $57,000, coming in at $57,650 (without Premium paint, which could have added additional $, had I selected one of the many optional colors offered.) My '12 Acura came with the color called Bellanova White Pearl while the Audi I configured was in a glossy hue they call Ibis White. A metallic white option on the Audi would have added another $550 to the MSRP. If you’re keeping score, the Audi starts out about $10,000 more than the Acura similarly contented. But simply saying they have similar content somehow makes the Audi seem expensive, a perspective I have come to believe is untrue. As the Automobile review declares, “[they] are significantly different only in the details.” Never a truer statement was said about these two cars. And, please, don’t for a minute think that somehow this is a knock on the Acura. Indeed, considering its performance & content, the TL SH-AWD Advance_ is_ rather a bargain (and I mean what I say only about the SH-AWD Advance version – what I say should not suggest I would make these remarks about other TL configurations). Perhaps were I given the opportunity to test a TL with both SH-AWD and the manual transmission, I would change my opinion. The Audi is neither over-priced nor is it a bargain – but, considering its price, it is unlikely you will find the S4’s luxury content and performance envelope replicated without spending thousands more. The current heart-throb car, the Lexus IS 350 F-Sport, offers a very high contented, audaciously styled machine to be sure, but its performance isn’t up to the S4’s; in fairness, however, an F-Sport even over loaded with optional stuff, will have trouble breaking the $50,000 MSRP barrier. There is, currently, no BMW 3-series M car (if you don’t include the 3-series” M” convertible, starting at $69,050, which I am not counting) – and if there were, it too would easily sail through a $65,000 price; besides, the comparison to the S4 would be incorrect, the BMW M would be more accurately compared to an RS – not S – Audi car. Back to the TL vs the S4. Both cars do what they do well – at their respective price points. The Acura – subjectively – may well represent/possess over 90% of the Audi’s performance. And, for the money asked, the Acura remains perhaps one of the biggest bargains today in the ELLPS category (assuming you can get over the exterior – and for some, the interior – styling). Here is what you get for your extra $10,000+ in the Audi S4: a palpable sense that anything and everything you want the car to do is effortless. From the S-Tronic’s apparent ability to read the driver’s mind, to an incredibly deep bucketful of power that is always ready a ¼ of a second before you ask for it, to an ability to corner that approaches violating the laws of physics, the S4 almost becomes an extension of the driver’s mind, rather like Green Lantern’s power-ring, I suspect. In contrast, the TL SH-AWD is not quite as much the natural athlete as the S4 – although it has nothing to be ashamed of, it’s just that to get 90% of the S4’s performance out of the TL, you have to work at it. Here’s one reason why: the TL’s well of torque isn’t as deep as the Audi’s and the TL’s torque doesn’t reach full-boil until significantly higher RPM’s (the TL's V6 is naturally aspirated vs the S4's supercharged V6). The consequences of less torque attained at higher RPM’s twisting through 6 (automatic) gears are not subtle – the Acura must be kept “cranked up” to get the most out of it. While doing this can be pretty rewarding, it is hardly effortless. Another huge disadvantage the TL has is its 6 speed traditional (it uses a torque converter) automatic transmission. The Audi’s 7-speed direct shift (twin-clutch) transmission by comparison feels as if the smoothest stick shift driver ever is selecting the perfect time for upshifts and downshifts. Coming to a stop, the Audi’s transmission downshifts both at the appropriate time but also with incredible precision and smoothness that I doubt any one of us contributors here could even come close to. In the final analysis, the 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance is a lot of car for the money – and I would still call it Acura’s S4. For $47,000+ there isn’t much – if anything – that comes close to the content and performance offered (if you can get past its unique styling and busy button-laden cockpit.) I had mine 40,000+ miles over less than a 30 month time period and other than what I assumed were weak brakes (the rotors were turned twice before 25K miles before the dealer determined the problem was three warped wheels which Acura replaced – at a 50% discount to me), the Acura would certainly seem to be well on its way to living up to its reputation for reliability – but at only 40,000 miles I assume most cars on the market today would still seem young. The 2014 S4 presumably produces performance numbers that bests the TL in almost every category, but for an additional $10,000 it ought to. The S4 does seem more substantive than the TL – of course you only really notice this aspect when you slam the doors or hit a pot-hole or find yourself on a “washboard” road surface. The Acura’s body seems to be of a thinner metal than the Audi, the TL's suspension upon rapid compression or over undulating surfaces seems on the verge of being brittle where the Audi, under similar circumstances, seems to absorb and rebound from rough surfaces with aplomb. If you’re looking for the TL to buy you much – if any – street cred from your buds, don’t count on it. Virtually everyone I know called my TL, “Mark’s Honda.” Truth be told, the main problem with the Acura – for me – was that it simply had “too much Honda” in it. Some years ago, Audis were sometimes said to have “too much VW” in them – regardless of the truth, the perception was sufficient, apparently, to motivate Audi to separate themselves as much as they could from VW. Thus far, Acura’s are often thought of as “Honda’s who know somebody.” More’s the pity, for the TL (at least) is a kind of “almost” car – it is almost many things: almost a luxury car, almost a sporty car – i.e., almost an LPS car. I can recommend the TL SH-AWD Advance for its likely street price (I got mine at nearly 13% off); the car is comfortable, well contented and highly competent at most, if not all, of the things we ask for in a premium vehicle. It didn’t inspire much passion and, frankly, didn’t seem to actually have been built to be passionate. The S4 inspires and it has passion – its “fun to drive factor,” which seems to be priced at about $10,000, has been abundantly imbued by its creators. Even after a crappy day, driving the S4 puts a smile on my face. That’s my story . . . and . . you know.

4966,"December 27, 2013  6:18PM",markcincinnati,"I agree with the comments about the beauty of the new Q50. I think it is very handsome on the outside and both inside and out it seems more upscale befitting its inclusion with its competition from Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Lexus & Mercedes to name a few. The issues with the Q50 seem NOT to be with its comeliness, rather with its steering feel or lack thereof. Other critiques seem to remind the reader that the 3.7L normally aspirated engine -- while somewhat more sound isolated in the Q50 -- is ""coarse"" and that the 7-speed transmission is a carryover. Now, having just turned in our 2011 FX35 after 60,000 miles, I would say even if there were no improvements in the transmission in the Q50, that it is a fine transmission. Likewise, the 3.7L engine is powerful even if not particularly blessed with an abundance of torque. After driving the new Q50, the ""thrash"" and coarseness often attributed to this engine has been muted significantly, but, this mill isn't up to the smoothness of the German 6-cylinder engines and one wonders why Infiniti hasn't noticed (apparently) that forced induction engines are the currently favored configuration. Overall, the Infiniti (at least this first venture out with the new Q50) seems unlikely to be finishing as the top choice against its German and Japanese competitors. I assume Infiniti was shooting to be the darling of the ELLPS set, but came up short compared to the Lexus IS 350 [F Sport, especially]. From a styling perspective, I find the Q50 to be handsome; it looks expensive. The IS 350 is, well, ""edgy"" with its audacious styling and spindle grill. The IS looks like it would be sporty (to me, at least), whereas the Q50's style might well be more enduring since -- compared to the IS -- it is more conservative, less in-your-face. Here's something, too, the ATS -- right out of the gate -- seems to have gotten a lot MORE right than the Q50, despite what many could have assumed was a head-start what with the Q50 coming from such good stock (the G37X). Now, at least here in Cincinnati, the Q50 seems to be subvented and discounted so heavily, that they ought to be flying out of the showroom. I have never seen one on the road (other than near the dealership where they are obviously being test-driven. This is pretty amazing, considering that I have seen the outrageously priced Audi RS 7 -- a car so rarified that I actually wouldn't consider not seeing it as indicative of anything. Not once seeing a Q50 is -- speaking as a fan of the brand -- well, sad. Hopefully Johan de Nysschen, the new Infiniti president, will be able to imbue future Infinitis with some of the Audi Magic he most certainly picked up on over his 19 years with Audi. Well, there's always next year -- I'd look for some under-the-covers changes for the Q50, sooner rather than later. But I could be wrong, just not uncertain.

4972,"January  7, 2014  4:48PM",graphicguy,"Someone asked for a compare/contrast with the new TL SH AWD and the previous one I had, in addition to a comparison to the S4. I just can't remember which thread asked for the post, so putting it here. I'll get this out of the way up front so ""markincincinnati"" doesn't raise his blood pressure. The S4 drives better, no question. In some areas, it's significantly better, in other areas just a smidgeon better. Then there are areas where the TL SH AWD is better. First, the difference between my former 4G TL SHA AWD and this one. The new one is smoother. There's no trans ""shifting"" feeling going on. My old one had the 5 speed auto. The new one, a 6 speed. I think the ratios are closer together which might account for the smoothness. And, I believe the 6th gear has a taller ratio than the old one. One tank of gas in, 50-50 driving, I got 23 MPG. Plenty acceptable. That's about 10% better than the old TL and about the same amount better than the S4. So, I like the new trans in the TL. It's not as good as the DSG 7 speed in the S4. But, it is better than the one in the previous. Again, smooth with good manual control via the paddle shifters. The S4 will bang gears with the best of them, automatic or manual, no ifs, ands or buts. The S4 is fast, without a doubt. It's probably the fastest sports sedan I've ever driven, and will rival many muscle cars. The TL is quick. It has plenty of power, especially once you get around the 3K RPM range where the torque kicks in. The S4 has torque all over the range rev. The new 6 speed in the TL makes it feel quicker than the old one. Again, different gear ratios. Handling-the TL is FWD based, even though it has the torque vectoring tick going on (as did the S4). So, there is a difference between the S4 and the SH AWD of the TL. Not as much as you might expect, though. They're really close in the handling dept. I find myself sometimes saying, ""I liked the S4 better"". At other times I find myself saying (""the TL SH AWD is as good as the S4, and also more forgiving""). Tough to choose one over the other. Ride-this goes to the new TL. I think Acura has out BMWd BMW with the ride/handling compromise. Acura must have recalibrated the suspension in some way. It's firm without being uncomfortable. Where the S4 sometimes crashes over bumps in the road, the TL absorbs them without drama. Seat comfort goes to the TL. They were, and continue to be some of the best sports seats in any car I've ever driven. They're snug without pinching (something the S4's seats sometimes do). Fit and finish is a tie. The old TL, the new TL and the S4 are all exemplary in fit and finish. However, as with the old TL, everything in the new TL just works the way it's supposed to. That's a far cry from what I experienced with the S4. All electronics work. There's no in car internet in the TL, but I let the uber expensive in car internet lapse in the S$ because it was slow, and unneeded. Since I did let it lapse in the S4, some of the NAV maps went bonkers (next to no information about the roads being displayed on the NAV). On the TL, it's straight forward, accurate and detailed. As good as the B&O stereo was in the S4, the system in the TL (ELS) is better. It's simply one of the best factory sound systems on the market, in any car. Styling, as always, is subjective. I liked the look of the older TL. I like the look of my new one better. I'm way in the minority here, though. The S4 is classic Audi with the LCD daytime running lights that everyone seems to like these days. I liked the look of the S4, too. Here's where markincinnati and I will part. I had the check from Audi buying back my S4. I pocketed around $14K and got the new TL SH AWD Advance...as loaded as you can get one. Is the S4 better? As I started, some ways yes, other ways no. Is it $14K better? Not even close...not even $10K better, and I'd have to try really, really hard to make a case that it's $5K better. Don't get me wrong. Both are really good cars. If you're looking to blow people's doors off at stop lights, while having a good handling 4 door, the S4 is for you. If you want something more well rounded, that does a lot of things well, the TL is for you (just don't go seeking any Mustang GTs down at a stop light...wait until you get into the corners).",id ive dont audis im saying comfort ridethis previous system feel auto forward performance let bo going really roads dsg gears doesnt performance compromise audi ever even new 23 together everything snug fords want makes far look fastest comparison case control first muscle different things cant works cars tank performance got bumps ill cry go smoother older beaudier maps like 7 expect rememercedeser thcadillac lightwait ands efficiency kicks closer paddle feeling detailed console performance rideperformance old asked work accurate quicker ratios internet els blood driven trans gear systems 4 shifting many ways sedan acceptable 10 sometimes went tick blow ddodgea performances pocketed liked vectoring sound seeking choose check forgiving unneeded theres tough fast comparecontrast since well smidgeon 5 try uber recalibrated days raise uncomfortable part 14k sh something puaudiing handlinfordhe thread advanceas based rounded dept car console driving performance market youre ford front plenty difference lapse times running simply around factory pressure continue yes much fit 10k stop range 4g supposed efficiency must loaded someone expensive bmw experienced minority 5k make theyre comforter significanacuray drives closenot always tie though electronics areas performance get markincinnati doors firm probably aspiration comfort nissanion quick via goes daytime 5050 peoples lconsole straight hard think started shifters smooth subjective post looking amount information smoothness account road 6 secadillac wrong next absorbs exemplary rev buts addition bang rival performance 3k back bonkers lights however crashes former ratio sha close especially performance markincincinnati ifs 6th buying good heres pinching believe styling without might finish displayed bmwd seems doubt performance way everyone find slow lot acura one performance door also corners mercedesssic

4976,"January  9, 2014  5:00PM",markcincinnati,"graphicguy - when I first came to the ""economic"" realization, in 2011, that I would feel the prudent choice for my next car (out of a 2009 Audi A4 Prestige) would not be another Audi (a new A4 to replace the '09 would have been about $100+ more per month and the lease term 6 months longer), I tested many brands. The 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance seemed like a good choice since it most reminded me of an Audi (and specifically it reminded me more of an S4 than an A4 2.0T with sport package.) I had read a 2010 Automobile Magazine comparison report of the S4 and TL which did say most folks would probably never cross shop the two cars, but overall, the TL SH-AWD was favorably reviewed even though it was ""out-gunned"" and out-priced by the S4. I find myself more in violent agreement with your thoughts than any other perspective. Your recent experience with an S4 certainly has made you come by your observations and opinions honestly. Indeed, your overview was balanced. The most subjective part of many purchases we make is typically ""value"" -- some folks will value an ""extra 10%"" sufficiently to allow them to cost-justify a 25% (or more in some cases) price difference. This is true in cars, clothes, food and seat choices at sporting events (to name just a few). The S4's creators, as I noted, seems to ""cost"" fun-to-drive at about $10,000 over the TL SH-AWD Advance. Today, I see the S4 as being worth the premium. In 2011, I could not cost-justify such a price delta. Bang for the buck does go to the Acura. I am thinking, too, that there are other high bang for the buck offerings available from Korea -- at the same time, I am also thinking the new Cadillac CTS is a lower value proposition than the previous generation CTS. Clearly these preferences are highly subjective. Objectively (or as objectively as possible), the Acura can be evaluated as having greater content per dollar than the Audi. Although more subjective in nature, I believe it is probable that any collection of ""professional"" reviewer's opinions about the two cars would reveal these reviewers to find the S4 more praise-worthy. Objective (measured) test results, too, would probably show the Audi's performance to be higher than the Acuras -- even if often only slightly thus. It all comes down to ""how much"" it is worth to you to have one vs the other. No such comparison is possible, given the 5-figure price difference between the two vehicles, but I wonder which car would be ""chosen"" if they were priced virtually identically and identically contented. I assume if the choice of a new loaded TL SH-AWD or a new loaded S4 were presented, and both had an asking price of $47,500, that the S4 would be chosen more frequently (the vast majority of the time.) Can't prove this, of course, but it would make for an interesting study of ""perceived value."" Today, therefore, I'll agree that the TL SH-AWD Advance offers a very high value; but, I will also -- today -- pay the upcharge for the S4 and attribute that price difference to the cost of the ""fun-to-drive"" factor.

At the end of the day, that's the reason there are so many choices, particularly in the ELLPS sliver of the market. Competition keeps all of these vehicles we discuss smack in the middle of what I consider some of the most desireable cars on the road. They are certainly among the most capable cars you can drive...probably in any of the individual brands' line up. Long and short of it, there's no wrong answer here. Since I'm fresh off of test drives, it's clear where some of these manufacturers are going. BMW, for reasons that befuddle me, are softening up their cars. I suspect most will like that. Personally, I don't. But, looks like it's helping them sell more cars. Same can be said for the Infiniti Q, although that softening doesn't seem to be helping them whatsoever in selling the new Q50. Shame. Benz is going for high style. I saw pics of the new C class, and drove the CLA. I'm guessing the new C will drive similarly to the old C. Nothing compelling there. CLA shows Benz trying to become the style leader while offering run of the mill driving dynamics. Seems to be working for them as they just surpassed BMW as the U.S. luxury car sales leader. Not my cup 'o tea, but they've been successful with that strategy. Audi keeps marching to their own beat. Good for them for doing it. To me, they are the performance leaders. Owning the S4, and having had A6s for extended periods of time as loaners, I can't fathom another manufacturer doing more to imbue their cars with fun to drive characteristics (reliability needs lots of work, though) If there's one place Acura has fallen down, it's in the style dept. They've got the engineering down. Their performance is competitive, their operation, build and reliability are rock solid.
